These relationships facilitate the selection of a concrete \nontology network life cycle model when a particular ontology network project is being \nscheduled. \n\u0001 Enhancement of the existing guidelines obtaining the concrete life cycle for an ontology \nnetwork and the scheduling of the ontology network project, described in the style proposed in \n[ 11] for methodological guidelines.  \nSuch improved guidelines are based on (1) the update of the ontology network life cycle \nmodels; and (2) a set of natural language questions related to ontology requirements. \nAlso as future work we have planned to evaluate the guidelines for scheduling ontology \nprojects in real use cases. \n\u0001 Proposal of a NeOn plug-in called gOntt for supporting the scheduling activity, based on the \nmethodological guidelines presented in this deliverable.  \nAs current work we are developing the first version of the gOntt plug-in that will be evaluated in \nreal use cases. \nAs future work we have plan to include in the gOntt plug-in the possibility of (1) establishing \nhuman resources restrictions and establishments and (2) including the history of the \ndevelopment, i.e., percentage of process or activity that has been done. \n",
