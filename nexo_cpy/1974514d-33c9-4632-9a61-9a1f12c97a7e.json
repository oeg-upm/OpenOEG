To\nmake this possible we need to change the conditions from\nnecessary conditions to necessary AND sufficient conditions.\n© O. Corcho, MC Suárez de Figueroa Baonza\n84\nOWL and SWRL\nA class that has at least one set of necessary and sufficient conditions is known as a\nDefined Class or Complete Class.\n",
