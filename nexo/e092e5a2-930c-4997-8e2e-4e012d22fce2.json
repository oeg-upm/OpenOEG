Identify the classiﬁcation scheme items whose their path enumeration values are\nequal to their key values, i.e. classiﬁcation scheme items without parents. Formally,\nevery cei ∈CE, vpath = vk.\n2. For each one of the above identiﬁed classiﬁcation scheme items cei:\n2.1. Create the corresponding ontology class, Ci class.\n2.2. Identify the classiﬁcation scheme items, cej, which are children of cei, by using\nthe path enumeration values.\n2.3. For each one of the above identiﬁed classiﬁcation scheme items cej:\n2.3.1. Create the corresponding ontology class, Cj class.\n2.3.2. Set up the subClassOf relation between Cj and Ci.\n2.3.3. Repeat from step 2.2 for cej as a new cei.\n3. If there are more than one classiﬁcation scheme items without parent cei\n3.1. Create an ad-hoc class as the root class of the ontology.\n3.2. Set up the subClassOf relation between Ci class and the root class.\nExample\n1. Create the LEGISLATORS, SENIOR OFFICIALS AND MANAGERS class.\n2. Create the Legislators and senior officials class, and set up the sub-\nClassOf relation between the Legislators and senior officials class\nand the LEGISLATORS, SENIOR OFFICIALS AND MANAGERS class.\n3. Create the Corporate managers class, and set up the subClassOf relation\nbetween the Corporate managers class and the LEGISLATORS, SENIOR\nOFFICIALS AND MANAGERS class.\n4. Create the PROFESSIONALS class.\n5. Create the Occupation class.\n6. Set\nup\nthe\nsubClassOf\nrelation\nbetween\nthe\nLEGISLATORS, SENIOR\nOFFICIALS AND MANAGERS class and the Occupation class.\n7. Set up the subClassOf relation between the PROFESSIONALS class and the\nOccupation class.\nRelationships\nRelations to other\nmodelling components\nUse the Architectural Pattern: TX-AP-01 [SFBG+07]\n",
