We know: \n•  Boxes in room 27 are smaller than those in room 28. \n•  All boxes in the same room are of the same size. \n \n \n•  In a given moment in time, we know: \n•  i)  Box A is inside room 27 or 28 (we do not know which one). \n \n \n•  ii)  Box B is inside room 27. \n  \n•  iii) Box B is not smaller than box A. \n \n•  We want to test whether box A is in room 27. \n",
