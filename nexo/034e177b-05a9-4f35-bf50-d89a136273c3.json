Scenarios for Building Ontology Networks \nIn this chapter each section, containing a particular scenario, is organized as follows: \n Assumptions for the scenario. For each of the presented scenarios, it is supposed that the \nscenario begins with the decision of whether a single ontology or an ontology network is \ngoing to be developed. In this chapter, it is assumed for all the scenarios that an ontology \nnetwork will be built. \n Prerequisite resources. \n Sequence of activities to be carried out. The included activities are taken from the NeOn \nGlossary of Activities.  \n Outcomes for the scenario. \n4.1. Scenario 1: Building Ontology Networks from Scratch without Reusing \nResources \n Assumptions: In this scenario it is supposed that software developers and ontology \npractitioners “want” to develop the ontology network from scratch (that is without reusing \nexisting resources). \n Prerequisite resources: Knowledge about the domain (general or specific) of the ontology \nnetwork to be developed should be available for the building of the ontology network. \n Sequences of activities: In this scenario (represented in Figure 20 by the arrow number 1), \nsoftware developers and ontology practitioners should follow the same activities for building \n \n",
