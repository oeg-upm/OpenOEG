There is one ontology which is mapped against all the databases. ODEMapster converts the query in ODEMQP to this ontology into several SQL queries which point to each database. The DQP component generates a query plan and distributes all the queries to its corresponding database.\nExplanation of SparqlDQP: SparqlDQP is an OGSA-DAI resource which distributes a query in SPARQL-D in the specified RDF stores. In this query there are specified queries to several and distributed SPARQL endpoints.\nBoth DQP systems could be integrated and access in one time to both SPARQL endpoints and RDB2RDF systems, using the same query,\nActually, this maybe could be done by using the OGSA-DAI resource developed by Carlos for accessing ODE-MAPSTER\nIn the end the goal would be to build a system that integrates: RDB2RDF tools, SPARQL endpoints, XML DB?, csv files?\nTwo bottlenecks (by the time being):\nODEMQL is not an option for querying data sources\nSPARQL-D should be modified and come back to the standard SPARQL without extensions\nCompetitors: SemWiq (\nhttp://www.langegger.at/papers/Langegger-phd-thesis.pdf\n)\nOur advantadge: query rewriting and inference using the global ontology\nPaper proposal:\nIntroduction\nTalk about the need of integrating data sources, etc. Introduction to the existing systems: SemWiq\nDescribe data repositories to be accessed\nRDB2RDF tools, SPARQL endpoints and others if possible\nHow we access indivisually to these data repositories\nDesign of the system\nquery rewriting, atchitecture, optimizations, etc.\nImplementation\nOGSA-DAI, ODEMapster, etc.\nConclusions + future work",
