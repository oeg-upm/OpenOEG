Clearly, after the ap-\nplication of the KD key(rm) = {jm}, we get an atom a such that at least two attributes\nof a have the same null. Note that it is not possible to get such an atom during the\nconstruction of chase(D,ΣT). Therefore, we can construct an atomic Boolean CQ\nq, i.e., with just one atom in its body, for which there exists a homomorphism h\nsuch that h(body(q)) = a, and thus h(body(q)) ∈chase(D,Σ), but there is no a ho-\nmomorphism h′ such that h′(body(q)) ∈chase(D,ΣT). Hence, ⟨⟩∈ans(q,D,Σ) but\n⟨⟩/∈ans(q,D,ΣT). Obviously, since in dom(D) we have just one constant of Γ , the\nchase does not fail.\nNow, suppose that the second condition of the Deﬁnition 1.4 is violated. This\nimplies that there exists a path v↷\n1 v↷\n2 ...↷vm, for m ⩾3, in G as in the Deﬁnition\n1.4, but there is no path of only r-nodes from vm to v2. Assume that v1 = e1[1] and\nvi = ri[ji], for each i ∈{2,...,m}. Consider the database D = {e1(c),rm(c,...,c)}.\nThe arc e[1]↷r2[j2] is necessarily labeled by the TGD\ne(X) →∃X1 ...∃Xj2−1∃Xj2+1 ...∃Xn r2(X1,...,Xj2−1,X,Xj2+1,Xn).\nHence, r2(z1,...,z j2−1,c,zj2+1,...,zn) is obtained during the chase, where, for\neach i ∈{1,..., j2 −1, j2 + 1,...,n}, zi ∈ΓN. Eventually, due to the path\nv↷\n2 ...↷vm, the atom rm(w1,...,w jm−1,c,w jm+1,...,wn) is generated, where\n{w1,...,w jm−1,w jm+1,...,wn} = {z1,...,zj2−1,zj2+1,...,zn}. Since vm is a k-\nnode, we replace wk with c, for each k ∈{1,..., jm −1, jm + 1,...,n}. Thus,\nwe get (among others) the atom r2(c,...,c). Instead, in chase(D,ΣT) the atom\nr2(z1,...,z j2−1,c,zj2+1,...,zn) remains in place, and there is no way to obtain the\natom r2(c,...,c) due to the absence of a path of only r-nodes from vm to v2 in G.\nNow, let us deﬁne the atomic Boolean CQ q = p ←r2(c,...,c). It is easy to see that\n⟨⟩∈ans(q,D,Σ) but ⟨⟩/∈ans(q,D,ΣT). Finally, since we have just one constant of\nΓ in dom(D), there is no chase failure.\nIt is straightforward to see that Theorem 1.2 holds for IPCDs and BACDs, since\nthese two classes are special cases of CDs. Moreover, for both IPCDs and BACDs\nthe property of being non-conﬂicting it is necessary for separability; the proof of\nthis result is similar to that of Theorem 1.3. The following corrollary follows imme-\ndiately.\nCorollary 1.1. Consider a set Σ of IPCDs or BACDs over a schema R. Σ is sepa-\nrable if and only if is non-conﬂicting.\n1.5 Query Answering under Non-Conﬂicting CDs\nLet us now investigate the data and combined complexity of the (decision) problem\nof conjunctive query answering under non-conﬂicting CDs.\n",
