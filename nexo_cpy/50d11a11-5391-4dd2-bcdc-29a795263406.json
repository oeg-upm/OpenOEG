Because of the open world\nassumption, until we explicitly say that a MargheritaPizza only has\nthese kinds of toppings, it is assumed (by the reasoner) that a\nMargheritaPizza could have other toppings.\nAutomatic Classification and Open World Assumption (III)\nTo specify explicitly that a MargheritaPizza has toppings that are\nkinds of MozzarellaTopping or kinds of MargheritaTopping and\nonly kinds of MozzarellaTopping or MargheritaTopping, we must\nadd what is known as a closure axiom or restriction on the\nhasTopping property.\nProtege 3.4\n© O.
