The cases where {c1,...,cn+1,c′\nn+1} ⊂ΓN, or\n{c1,...,cn} ⊂Γ\nand {cn+1,c′\nn+1} ⊂ΓN, or for some i ∈[n], ci ∈Γ\nand\n{c1,...,ci−1,ci+1,...,cn+1,c′\nn+1} ⊂ΓN, are excluded since, by deﬁnition of CDs,\na and b must be the same atom which is a contradiction. Now, consider the case\nwhere {c1,...,cn+1} ⊂Γ and c′\nn+1 ∈ΓN (the case where {c1,...,cn,c′\nn+1} ⊂Γ\nand cn+1 ∈ΓN is symmetric). By deﬁnition of CDs, c′\nn+1 does not occur else-\nwhere in chase[k−1](D,Σ). By applying κ we just eliminate atom b, and hence\nchase[k](D,Σ) ⊂chase[k−1](D,Σ). Therefore, hk = hk−1.\nWe continue to consider the case where κ is of the form key(r) = {1} (without\nloss of generality we assume the ﬁrst attribute to form the key). This implies that in\nchase[k−1](D,Σ) we have the atoms a = r(c1,c2,...,cn) and b = a(c1,c′\n2,...,c′\nn). If\n{c1,...,cn,c′\n2,...,c′\nn} ⊂Γ , then chase(D,Σ) fails and the claim holds trivially. The\ncase where {c1,...,ci−1,ci+1,...,cn,c′\n2,...,c′\nj−1, c′\nj+1,...,c′\nn} ⊂ΓN and {ci,c′\nj} ⊂\nΓ , for some i, j ∈{2,...,n}, is excluded since, by deﬁnition of CDs, a and b must\nbe the same atom which is a contradiction. We deﬁne µ = {c′\ni →ci}2⩽i⩽n. During\nthe application of the violated KD we apply µ to chase[k−1](D,Σ) and the atom b is\neliminated (the case where µ = {ci →c′\ni}2⩽i⩽n and a is eliminated is symmetric).\nConsider an arbitrary atom c ∈chase[k−1](D,Σ), where dom(c)∩{c′\n2,...,c′\nn} is not\nempty. We are going to show that hk−1(µ(c)) ∈chase(D,ΣT). Suppose that the atom\nb is obtained during the chase due to the application of the TGD σ ∈ΣT. We proceed\nby case analysis on the type of σ.\nLet σ = a(X1,...,Xn,Y) →r(X1,...,Xn), where a ∈far(R). Observe that, by\ndeﬁnition of CDs, the atoms generated during the chase due to the application of\nσ are necessarily of the form r(d1,...,dn), where {d1,...,dn} ⊂Γ . Therefore,\nthis case is not possible since {c′\n2,...,c′\nn} ⊂ΓN.\nAssume now that σ = e(X) →∃X2 ...∃Xn r(X,X2,...,Xn), where e ∈fe(R).\nClearly, the labeled nulls c′\n2,...,c′\nn are created during the application of σ, i.e., b\nis the atom at which c′\n2,...,c′\nn are invented during the construction of the chase.\nTherefore, the atom c is obtained starting from b. Since, by induction hypoth-\nesis, hk−1(µ(b)) ∈chase(D,ΣT), it follows that hk−1(µ(c)) ∈chase(D,ΣT), as\nneeded.\nSuppose now that σ = r′(X1,...,Xn) →r(Xi1,...,Xin), where r′ ∈fr(R) and\n[i1,...,in] is a permutation of [n]. Assume ﬁrst that c is such that pred(c) ∈\nfr(R) and dom(c) = {c1,c′\n2,...,c′\nn}. By deﬁnition of non-conﬂicting CDs,\nthe only way to obtain b during the chase is due to a path P of the form\ne[1]↷s1[j1]↷...↷sm[jm]↷r′[jm+1]↷r[1], where m ⩾0, { j1,..., jm+1} ⊆[n], e ∈\nfe(R) and {s1,...,sm} ⊂fr(R), in the CD-graph G of Σ. Note that e[1] is an\ne-node, and all the other nodes in P are r-nodes. Moreover, due to the exis-\ntence of κ in ΣK, r[1] is a k-node. In case that c is obtained starting from b,\nthen hk−1(µ(c)) ∈chase(D,ΣT) since, by induction hypothesis, hk−1(µ(b)) ∈\nchase(D,ΣT). The interesting case is when c is generated before b due to the\nexistence of the path P. By deﬁnition of non-conﬂicting CDs, in G we have\na path P′ of only r-nodes from r[1] to s1[j1]. Furthermore, the permutation\nπG(C), where C is the cycle r[1]↷...↷s1[j1]↷...↷sm[jm]↷r′[jm+1]↷r[1] in G,\n",
