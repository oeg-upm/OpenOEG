Villazón\n56\nOntological Engineering\nSlide 56\nOntology Requirements Specification. \nTask 6\nInput: the set of grouped CQs\nObjective: to identify possible conflicts between\nCQs, missing CQs, and contradictions in CQs. To\ndecide if such CQs are valid or not\nOutput: a confirmation about the validity of the\nset of CQs\nCriteria:\nCorrectness.\nCompleteness.\nConsistent.\nVerificable.\nUnderstandable.\nNo Ambiguity.\nConciseness.\nRealism.\nModifiable.\nTraceable.\nCorrectness. Domain experts checked the correctness of each\ncompetency question, verifying that its formulation and answers\nwere correct.\nConsistent. Domain experts also verified that the competency\nquestions did not have any possible inconsistency.\n",
