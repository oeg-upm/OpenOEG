First to look at the readme file in the DistributedSail directory and follow its instructions. According to Simon Schenk that's all that I should need.\nThese instructions are:\nDownload the project (bzr branch lp:networkedgraphs)\nBuild the project: mvn install, mvn eclipse:eclipse\nUse it (next section)\nUsage\n\nCheck out\nhttp://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/users/\nfor Sesame information\nI guess I have to configure a repository,\nwhere should I store it? In memory, it is possible to configure it as a normal Sesame repository accessed by means of the API\nhow do I configure it? just API commands\nhow is it accessed? later on, you configure the elements in the repository by an n3 file\nIs it executed by the DistributedSail or by the standard Sail from Sesame? distirbuted sail\nConfiguration file example:\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rep: <http://www.openrdf.org/config/repository#>.\n@prefix sr: <http://www.openrdf.org/config/repository/sail#>.\n@prefix sail: <http://www.openrdf.org/config/sail#>.\n@prefix ns: <http://www.openrdf.org/config/sail/native#>.\n@prefix ds: <http://isweb.uni-koblenz.de/Ontologies/DistributedSAIL/config/sail#>.\n[] a rep:Repository ;\n   rep:repositoryID \"{%Repository ID|federator%}\" ;\n   rdfs:label \"{%Repository title|Distributed Sail with RepositorySourceFinder%}\" ;\n   rep:repositoryImpl [\n      rep:repositoryType \"openrdf:SailRepository\" ;\n      sr:sailImpl [\n         sail:sailType \"isweb:NGSail\" ;\n         sail:delegate [      sr:sailImpl [\n            sail:sailType \"isweb:DistributedSail\" ;\n            ds:hasSourceFinder [\n               ds:hasConfGraph {%Configuration Graph|<http://demetrios.isweb.uni-koblenz.de/federator/endpoints>%};\n               a ds:RepositorySourceFinder\n            ];\n            sail:delegate [\n               sail:sailType \"openrdf:NativeStore\" ;\n               ns:tripleIndexes \"{%Triple indexes|spoc,posc%}\"\n            ];\n         ];\n      ]\n   ].\nOnce the repository has been configured we have to tell to DistributedSail to which sails (aka networked graphs) we can access. This is done by means of another configuration file in which there are specified all the NGs available.",
