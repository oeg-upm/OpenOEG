Scenarios for Building Ontologies and Ontology Networks \nThe nine identified scenarios are named in the following way: \n\u0001 Scenario 1: From specification to implementation. \n\u0001 Scenario 2: Reusing and reengineering non-ontological resources. \n\u0001 Scenario 3: Reusing ontological resources. \n\u0001 Scenario 4: Reusing and reengineering ontological resources. \n\u0001 Scenario 5: Reusing and merging ontological resources. \n\u0001 Scenario 6: Reusing, merging and reengineering ontological resources. \n\u0001 Scenario 7: Reusing ontology design patterns.  \n\u0001 Scenario 8: Restructuring ontological resources. \n\u0001 Scenario 9: Localizing ontological resources. \nKnowledge acquisition, documentation, configuration management, evaluation and assessment \nshould be carried out all along the ontology development, that is, in any scenario used for \ndeveloping the ontology network. \nFrom this set of scenarios, we can say that scenario 1 is the most typical for building ontologies \nand ontology networks without reusing existing knowledge resources. Moreover, the identified \nscenarios within the NeOn methodology are flexible because their combination is allowed within \nthe development of ontologies and ontology networks. It is worth mentioning that any combination \nof scenarios should include scenario 1 because this scenario is made up of the core activities that \nhave to be performed in any ontology development. Indeed, as Figure 5 shows, the results of any \nother scenario should be integrated in the corresponding activity of scenario 1.  \nAs mentioned above, in this section, we include the description of scenario 7 (reusing ontology \ndesign patterns) that was not described in previous deliverables. Such a description includes the \n",
