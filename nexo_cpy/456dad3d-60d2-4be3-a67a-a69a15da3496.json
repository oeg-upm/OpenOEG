These questions are related with aspects such as\nhelp, documentation, and speed of the system. These aspects have not been\ncovered because our Control Point is still a prototype instead of a \u001cnal product.\nConsidering this, we can conclude that our Control Point provides reasonable\nvalues for usability and user satisfaction concerning the user interface for a wide\nrange of users.\n7\nConclusions and Future Work\nWe have described an extension to a multimedia management system infrastruc-\nture that is currently being used in the context of home environments to share\nand render multimedia resources. This extension allow us to perform these shar-\ning and rendering tasks across homes, in a WAN setting, with authentication\nand authorization control, overcoming some of the inherent limitations to the\nUPnP-based infrastructures.\nBesides the basic extensions needed for the exchange of multimedia resources\nacross homes, we have given users the possibility of providing rich ontology-\nbased annotations of their resources, as they can do in other existing multimedia\nannotation tools [4,2,13], with simple search interfaces over the Web of Data in\norder to retrieve and copy or link to existing URIs and annotations. The major\ninnovation in this aspect is the use of a Semantic Grid-based architecture and\ninfrastructure for the distributed management of this metadata.\nWe o\u001ber users the possibility of publishing their annotations in Linked-Data,\ntaking into account that their multimedia resources have global URIs and that\nour metadata servers can perform the corresponding content negotiation in order\nto return RDF information when needed.\n",
