We therefore cannot\nassume that an individual is not a member of a particular class\nsimply because it has not been asserted to be a member of that\nclass.\nIn order to ‘separate’ a group of classes we must make them\ndisjoint from one another. This ensures that an individual which\nhas been asserted to be a member of one of the classes in the group\ncannot be a member of any other classes in that group.\n",
