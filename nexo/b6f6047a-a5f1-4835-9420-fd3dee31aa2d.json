Structuring the problem\nDocumentation availability and quality (A/Q Document) refers to whether there is \nany communicable material used to describe or explain different aspects of the \ncandidate ontology, as well as the enacted development process. \nA discrete attribute with three possible values has been established :\n• \nlow, when the candidate ontology has no documentation;\n• \nmedium, when the candidate ontology has documentation (in the form of web page, wiki, and/or \npaper) detailing the ontology; and\n• \nhigh, when the candidate ontology has documentation (in the form of web page, wiki, and/or \npaper) detailing both the candidate ontology and its development process (ORSD, modeling \ndecisions, etc.). \nCode documentation (Code Documen) refers to whether the ontology code is \ndocumented. \nA continuous attribute ([0,100]) was used:\nwhere #CommentedOntologyElements is the number of elements commented in the ontology  \n(rated by searching the code for the “#rdfs:comment” string) and #OntologyElements is the \nnumber of elements in the ontology (#OntologyElements = 1+ #Classes + #ObjectProperties + \n#DatatypeProperties + #Instances).\n#CommentedOntologyElements\n#OntologyElements\n×100,\nAdequacy of naming conventions (Naming Conv) refers to whether the two  \nontologies (the candidate ontology and the ontology under development) follow the \nsame rules for naming the different ontology components. \nA binary attribute\n• \nvalue 1 when the candidate ontology and the ontology under development follow the same \nnaming conventions \n• \nvalue 0 when they do not. \n",
