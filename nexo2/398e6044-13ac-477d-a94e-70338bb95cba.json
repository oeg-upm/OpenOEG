A pattern \ncovers a set of requirements, if it is expressive enough to store the necessary knowledge to \nanswer the full set of competency questions (CQs) representing the requirements. \n\nCloning involves making a duplicate of an ontology element, in some cases including all axioms \ndefining the element or in some cases only making a partial clone.\n\nComposition is the way of combining two or more patterns, where the result in case of content \npatterns is the union of the axioms of all the patterns together with any additional axioms used to \nlink the elements of the different patterns.\n\nSpecialization and generalization are relations among patterns, as well as among elements. \nSpecialization is also a way of reusing a content pattern, when the elements are specialized and \nthereby form a new ontology tailored to some specific requirements.\n\nExpansion is when a pattern is extended with additional elements or axioms.\n\nImporting is a basic operator for content pattern reuse (since already available in OWL) and is \nthe standard way of reusing such OPs.\nContent Pattern Reuse: Basic Operations\n",
