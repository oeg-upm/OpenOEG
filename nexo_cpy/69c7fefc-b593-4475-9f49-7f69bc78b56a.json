It's not fancy, but it works relatively well. We need an expert in distributed and federated query environments and optimization to take this base system and turn it into a super high performance system. This is a core position for us, as this system sits at the base of several other systems built on top of it.\nIt would be a plus if you were in the US as it makes collaboration a bit easier, but it isn't necessary. We have worked with distributed teams before -- takes effort and care but definitely doable, especially for the right person.\nResponsibilities\nBuild a high performance scalable distributed/federated query environment and optimizer for a system where the underlying data source can be pretty much anything -- relational databases, spreadsheets, XQuery sources, web services, flat files, etc\nSkills\nYou must understand distributed and federated query systems and optimizations inside and out. So cost based and dynamic optimizations, streaming architectures, topological considerations, etc, etc.\nIt would be a plus if you knew about RDF, SPARQL and semantic web technologies, but it isn't necessary as all that can be learned as need be.\nCompensation\nEquity until funding, then equity and money :-)\nhttp://www.startuply.com/Jobs/Distributed_Federated_Query_Expert_2695_2.aspx",
