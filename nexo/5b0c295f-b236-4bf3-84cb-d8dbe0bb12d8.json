Villazón\n9\nOntological Engineering\nCP Reuse Basic Operations\n\u0002\nCovering is related to the requirements that are to be solved by a model, or a \npattern. A pattern covers a set of requirements, if it is expressive enough to store the \nnecessary knowledge to answer the full set of competency questions (CQs) \nrepresenting the requirements. \n\u0002\nCloning involves making a duplicate of an ontology element, in some cases including \nall axioms defining the element or in some cases only making a partial clone.\n\u0002\nComposition is the way of combining two or more patterns, where the result in case \nof content patterns is the union of the axioms of all the patterns together with any \nadditional axioms used to link the elements of the different patterns.\n\u0002\nSpecialization and generalization are relations among patterns, as well as among \nelements. Specialization is also a way of reusing a content pattern, when the \nelements are specialized and thereby form a new ontology tailored to some specific \nrequirements.\n\u0002\nExpansion is when a pattern is extended with additional elements or axioms.\n\u0002\nImporting is a basic operator for content pattern reuse (since already available in \nOWL) and is the standard way of reusing such OPs.\n",
