Villazón\n28\nOntological Engineering\nReusing Ontology Statements. \nOntology Statement Integration\nThe question here is: how to reuse the selected ontology \nstatements.\nThere are three modes:\n\u0001 Import the selected ontology statements.\n\u0001 Copy the selected ontology statements.\n\u0001 Map the selected ontology statements.\nAfter reusing an ontology statement, the following work must \nbe probably done: \n\u0001 changing names (concepts, properties) to adapt them to the \nnaming conventions used in the ontology network being \ndeveloped.\n\u0001 adding range in properties; and changing cardinalities.\n\u0001 restrictions should be added too.\n\u0001 check local inconsistencies in the ontology network.\n",
