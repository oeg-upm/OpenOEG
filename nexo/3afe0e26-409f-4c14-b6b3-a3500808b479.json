A class \nmay have multiple superclasses and subclasses. \nSubclass-of is transitive: if (subclass-of C1 C2) and \n(subclass-of C2 C3) then (subclass-of C1 C3). \nObject-centered systems sometimes distinguish \nbetween a subclass-of relationship that is asserted \nand one that is inferred. For example, (subclass-of \nC1 C3) might be inferred from asserting (subclass-of \nC1 C2) and (subclass-of C2 C3)...\"\n \n:iff-def \n   (and (Class ?parent-class) \n            (Class ?child-class) \n            (forall (?instance) \n               (=> (Instance-Of ?instance ?child-class) \n                      (Instance-Of ?instance ?parent-class)))) \n:axiom-constraints \n   (Transitive-Relation Subclass-Of)\n:issues \n   ((:see-also direct-subclass-of) \n    (:see-also \"In CycL, subclass-of is called #%allGenls\nbecause it is a slot from a collection to all of its   \ngeneralizations  (superclasses).\" \n               \"In the KL-ONE literature, subclass \nrelationships are also called subsumption relationships \nand ISA is sometimes used for subclass-of.\") \n    (\"Why is it called Subclass-of instead of subclass or \nsuperclass?\" \n     \"Because the latter are ambiguous about the order of \ntheir arguments. We are following the naming \nconvention that a binary relationship is read as an \nEnglish sentence `Domain-element Relation-name \nRange-value'.
