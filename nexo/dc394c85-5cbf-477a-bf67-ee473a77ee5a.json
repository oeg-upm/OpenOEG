They use the same \nterms.  \nComplex mappings due to terminology \nheterogeneity. \nMappings between Local \nOntologies and ES schema \nsources  \nComplex mappings due to terminology and \nstructural heterogeneity.  \nMappings are not complex. They use \nthe same terms.  \nBuilding process \nStructured/guided by the architecture of the \nReference Ontology and scoped with \napplications needs. \nRequires more sophistication of \nknowledge engineering and good \nacquaintance of all the data and their \nstructures of the application. \nChanges in the Reference \nOntology \nImply changes in  \n   · the mappings between local and reference \nontologies.  \n   · the mappings between the local ontologies \nand the ES schema sources. \n   · the Local Ontology. \nImply changes in  \n   · the mappings between Local \nOntologies and the Reference \nOntology. \nChanges in the ES schema \nsources \nImply changes in  \n   · its Local Ontology (probably the part that is \nnot a mirror of the Reference Ontology).  \n   · the mappings between Local Ontologies and \nES schema sources. \n   · in the mappings between Local Ontology \nand the Reference Ontology. \nImply changes in  \n   · the Local Ontologies.  \n   · in mappings between ES sources \nand Local Ontologies.  \n   · mappings between local and the \nReference Ontology. \n",
