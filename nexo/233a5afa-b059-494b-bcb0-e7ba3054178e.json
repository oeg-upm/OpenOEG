Consensus Reaching Process \nThe detailed stages of the consensus reaching process for the NeOn Glossary of Activities are the \nfollowing: \n1. To create a NeOn wiki page dedicated to the consensus reaching process, within the NeOn \nconsortium. We used this wiki page within the NeOn consortium to build collaboratively and by \nconsensus the NeOn Glossary of Activities. This technology was chosen because wiki web \nsites facilitates to reach a consensus by community members [57]. The non public wiki page \nwas created in mid-June 2006. At such moment, the argumentation tool “Cicero” (to be \nincluded in D2.3.1 due in M20) was not available for using in the consensus reaching process. \n2. To create a template for gathering information about activities and to publish this template in \nthe dedicated wiki page. The template shown in Table 1 is presented to gather not only \npossible activity definitions but also, other general information useful for future methodological \nwork within WP5, like the input and ouput for the activity. The template was built and published \nin mid-June 2006. \n2006–2007 © Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions. \n \n",
