Users are unaware that this is an integrated source, i.e. they do not know \nwhich sources are being used.\n●\nQuery Compiler eats the query as described in the previous section (parses SPARQL_stream, \nperforms logical and physical optimization and uses the mappings metadata to determine which \nsources will be used to produce the data. the result is a complete execution plan including the \nsub-parts to be sent to the sources and the sub plan to integrate the incoming data.\n●\nQuery Execution uses the generated plan to send the sub-plans as queries to the correspondent \nsources, gather the results and perform the merging, join operations remaining to generate the \nfinal results sent back to the user.\n \n \n \n",
