However, at large scale it is not feasible to retrieve all the information from all sources using only semantics to keep the correctness of data. The goal is to create a query planning algorithm that uses the semantic and quality description of a set of sources to choose the relevant ones and the right order and parameters to query them, maximizing the quality in the response returned to the user, i.e. maximizing positive parameters and minimizing negative ones.\nThis thesis is included in the\nData Integration Working Group\n.\nThis thesis is framed in the\nLarge-scale data integration\narea.\nTasks\n\nNot here, but\nthere\n.\nBibliography\n\nAs this thesis is included in the\nData Integration Working Group\nits biliography\nshould be considered, however, some aspects in this thesis are not common to the whole working group, therefore the bibliography includes also\narticles about sensor networks and how to model them\n. Also the\nbibliography in Large-scale data integration\nis relevant.",
