(in every model I of O, CI ⊆ DI ) \n• \nEquivalence – check knowledge is minimally redundant (no unintended \nsynonyms) \n-  Is C equivalent to D w.r.t. O? (in every model I of O, CI = DI ) \n• \nConsistency – check knowledge is meaningful (classes can have \ninstances) \n-  Is C satisfiable w.r.t. O? (there exists some model I of O s.t. CI ≠ ∅ ) \n• \nInstantiation and querying \n-  Is x an instance of C w.r.t. O? (in every model I of O, xI ∈ CI ) \n-  Is (x,y) an instance of R w.r.t. O? (in every model I of O, (xI,yI) ∈ RI ) \n• \nAll reducible to KB satisfiability or concept satisfiability w.r.t. a KB \n• \nCan be decided using highly optimised tableaux reasoners  \n56 \n",
