SUMI[] studies the following 5 dimensions:\nEfficiency: measures the degree to which users feel that the software assists\nthem in their work and is related to the concept of transparency.\nAffect: measures the user’s general emotional reaction to the software (aka\nLikeability).\nHelpfulness: measures the degree to which the software is self-explanatory, as\nwell as more specific things like the adequacy of help facilities and documentation.\nControl: measures the extent to which the user feels in control of the software,\nas opposed to being controlled by the software, when carrying out the task.\nLearnability: measures the speed and facility with which the user feels that they\nhave been able to master the system, or to learn how to use new features when\nnecessary.\nHow to use it\n\nFor this task we will request ontology editors to fulfill an online SUMI survey (e.g.\nat\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/\n) that is the de facto industry standard evaluation\nquestionnaire consisting of 50 statements (10 for each dimension) to which the user\nhas to reply that he either Agree, Don’t know, or Disagree. Users select Agree or\nDisagree if the statement is generally true or wrong respectively. The third option\n(Don’t know) is selected if the user is undecided, cant make up his mind, or if the\nstatement has no relevance to the software or to the situation",
