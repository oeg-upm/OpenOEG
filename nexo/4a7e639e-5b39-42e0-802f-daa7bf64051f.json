Villazón\n3\nOntological Engineering\nPatterns\nPattern is something proposed for imitation. \nDesign Pattern refers to shared guidelines that help solve design problems.\nOntology Design Pattern (ODP) is a modeling solution to solve a recurrent ontology\ndesign problem.\nOur concept of “pattern” is associable with the wider “good/best practice” of software \nengineering.
