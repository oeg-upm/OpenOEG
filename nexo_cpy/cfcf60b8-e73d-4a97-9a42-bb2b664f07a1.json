Spiral ontology network life cycle model \n5.2. NeOn Activity Classification based on IEEE groups \nBased on IEEE activity groups [4], we have grouped the 53 activities identified in the NeOn \nGlossary of Activities (Chapter 3) into five main activity groups. The full set of activities covers the \nentire ontology network life cycle. The groups provide an administrative classification to present the \nactivities in a more coherent way.  \nThe main activity groups, as presented in Figure 34, are the following:  \n1. Management activities include the following three activities: scheduling, control and ontology \nquality assurance.   \n2. Development-oriented activities are grouped into pre-development, development and post-\ndevelopment activities. \nThe pre-development activities include the following activities: ontology environment study, \nontology feasibility study, ontology reuse, ontology reengineering, non ontological resource \nreuse, and non ontological resource reengineering. \nThe development activities include the following activities: ontology specification, ontology \nconceptualization, ontology formalization, ontology implementation, ontology integration, \n",
