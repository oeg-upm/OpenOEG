For this purpose, such a \ncommittee needs an ontology network able to model information about the sports \n(summer and winter), about countries and teams involved, about venues and \ndates, and about medals and winners”.\nNote: each group should focus on winter or summer sports; and should select \none particular sport to define it in more detail.\nWorking in Pairs\n",
