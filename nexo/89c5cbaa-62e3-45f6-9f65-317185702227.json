Earthquakes in Castell´on during September and October 2013.\nthe earthquake occurred, its geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude), and\na string referring to the location. The coordinate reference system used by oﬃcial\norganizations in Spain is ETRS89.9\n4.2\nCleaning and formatting the earthquakes dataset\nWe used LODReﬁne to clean and re-format the earthquakes dataset.10 LO-\nDReﬁne is a powerful open source tool to deal with messy data. First, we re-\nnamed the columns to have more readable headers, e.g. magnitude instead of\nMag.. Then, we removed the intensity column because many cells were empty.\nWe also removed all the observation rows that did not include the depth value.\nThe columns date and time were merged to a unique timestamp column and\nformatted following the W3C datetime guidelines. In the dataset, we noted that\ndiﬀerent types of magnitudes are used in the observations,11 but they are con-\nsistent for small- and mid-scale earthquakes according to IGN. It is out of the\nscope of this paper to normalize the diﬀerent types of magnitudes to a unique\nscale.\nOne of the most helpful tools of LODReﬁne is the application of transfor-\nmations from a dataset to another one. We worked with a subset of the dataset\nfor October and November 2013 and then, we extracted the transformations\n(in JSON format) and applied them to the complete dataset. The results are\navailable online in CSV format.12\n9 Also known as EPSG:4258, see http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4258.\n10 http://code.zemanta.com/sparkica/index.html\n11 Diﬀerent\ntypes\nof\nmagnitudes\nexplained\n(in\nSpanish)\nhere\nhttp://www.ign.es/ign/head/sismoTipoMagnitud.do\n12 https://www.dropbox.com/s/wmsah6k6h537s0i/Earthquakes-Spain-2013.csv\n",
