(2008), 'Querying Distributed RDF Data Sources with SPARQL', The \nSemantic Web: Research and Applications , 524--538 . \nFunctionality\n●\nDistributed SPARQL, sources are SPARQL endpoints\n●\nIntroduces service descriptions: capabilities of endpoints: i.e. what kind of triple patterns \ncan be answered.\n●\nDescriptions include statistical info: # of triples, selectivity of triple pattern\n●\nDescription using own vocabulary in RDF\n●\nAbout the sub-queries (portions of queries that can be answered by a source), they can \nhave multiple triple patterns on them, as the algorithm of sub-query generation describes \nthis step.\nOptimisations\n●\nLogical: \n○\nUse rules for rewriting, merging patterns and replacing variables by constants \nfrom filter expressions \n○\nMove value constraints into sub-queries if possible.\n●\nPhysical: find best plan among all possible. Compare using a cost model, the goal is to \nreduce the amount of transferred data and transmissions.\n○\nQuery result size estimation using the provided statistics\n○\nTransfer cost of joins calculated\nLimitations\n●\nNo mapping/translation rules between the endpoints (no reconciliation)\n●\nVocabularies of endpoints may be different\n●\nNeed to explicitly provide service description for sources, how are statistics updated?\n●\nIdentify the SPARQL queries that can be handled\n●\nOnly bound predicates considered\nArchitecture\n●\nMediator based\n●\nSources are SPARQL endpoints (wrapped or not)\nStatus\n●\nResearch prototype, not continued.\nSemWIQ\nLangegger, A.; Wöß, W. & Blöchl, M.
