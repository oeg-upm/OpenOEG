To reach a consensus in ad-hoc meetings and via e-mail. Two ad-hoc meetings to review \nand agree on the definitions of activities of the NeOn Glossary took place at the Bled \nplenary meeting (January 23rd 2007) and at the Dubrovnik plenary meeting (June 29th \n2007), respectively.  \nDuring such meetings, the following informal rules for accepting or not a concrete activity \ndefinition were taken into account: \n If the team’s comments were generally positive and no major objections were \nraised, then the definition was considered as final. \n If general comments were positive, but someone had a major objection to the \ndefinition, the definition was modified until no major objection was encountered.  \n If the team’s comments were generally negative, the definition was ruled out.  \n If the team’s comments were mixed, there were three possibilities: \n \ndiscussions continued until positive or negative results were achieved;  \n \ndiscussions were postponed until the next meeting; and  \n \nthe issue was postponed until more information was available in the wiki.  \n If discussions seemed to be going on forever without the possibility of reaching an \nagreement, the team could: \n \ndecide to drop the definition, or the activity; or \n \nmove onto approval by voting the definition. The selected voting procedure was \nbased on absolute majority. \n",
