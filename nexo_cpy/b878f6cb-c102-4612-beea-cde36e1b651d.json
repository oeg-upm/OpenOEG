In particular\n• WP1. The resultant ontology, after the re-engineering process, will follow the networked model pro-\nposed on WP1.\n• WP5. The methods proposed within this deliverable will be included in the NeOn Methodology for\nbuilding ontology networks, speciﬁcally in the scenario for reusing and re-engineering non-ontological\nresources.\n• WP6. The tools proposed in this deliverable, which give technological support to the methods, will be\nintegrated into the NeOn ToolKit.\n• WP7 and WP8.
