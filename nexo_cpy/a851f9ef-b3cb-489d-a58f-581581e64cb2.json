Graph matching techniques  \n•  RDF inference is based on graph matching \ntechniques \n•  Basically, the RDF inference process consists of the \nfollowing steps: \n-  Transform an RDF query into a template graph that has to \nbe matched against the RDF graph \n•  It contains constant and variable nodes, and constant \nand variable edges between nodes \n-  Match against the RDF graph, taking into account constant \nnodes and edges \n-  Provide a solution for variable nodes and edges \n56 \n",
