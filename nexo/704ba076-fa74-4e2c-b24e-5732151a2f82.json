Example of CommonKADS Cycle [50] \nThe IDEAL methodology [34] proposes a conical-spiral life cycle model (shown in Figure 8), \nbased on Boehm’s spiral model but in three dimensions, for the case of KBS [39]. The authors [39] \nclaim that a KBS life cycle model cannot be defined by means of the two axis of the classical \nsoftware (cost and time), but by the addition of a new axe, which reflects the intrinsic characteristic \nof knowledge. This new axe could be the quality of knowledge which, like cost and time, increases \nduring the life of a KBS. The third dimension of the conical-spiral life cycle model would correspond \nto adaptative or perfective maintenance, i.e., to the incorporation of new knowldege that the expert \nacquires in time into the system. Since knowledge generates always new knowledge, a kind of \nadaptative maintenance, where new knowledge is added to the system as experts obtain new \nexperience, is always necessary. Perfective or adaptatitve maintenance means to build in new \nknowledge acquired by the expert at a later stage. This would call for another spiral life-cycle with \nshorter stages and smaller prototypes, located on another plane, to produce the spiral cone [11]. \n",
