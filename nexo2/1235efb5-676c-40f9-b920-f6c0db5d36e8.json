Literally \"not-\nknowing,\" from ne- \"not\" (from PIE root *ne-\n\"not\") + stem of scire \"to know\" (compare with \nscience). \"The sense development has been \nextraordinary, even for an adj.\" [Weekley] --\nfrom \"timid, faint-hearted\" (pre-1300); to \"fussy, \nfastidious\" (late 14c.); to \"dainty, delicate\" (c. \n1400); to \"precise, careful\" (1500s, preserved in \nsuch terms as a nice distinction and nice and \nearly); to \"agreeable, delightful\" (1769); to \n\"kind, thoughtful\" (1830).\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n",
