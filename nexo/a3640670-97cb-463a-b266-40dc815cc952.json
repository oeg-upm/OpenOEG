Three new profiles\n•\nOWL2 EL\n–\nOntologies that define very large numbers of classes and/or properties, \n–\nOntology consistency, class expression subsumption, and instance checking can be decided in \npolynomial time. \n•\nOWL2 QL\n–\nSound and complete query answering is in LOGSPACE (more precisely, in AC0) with respect \nto the size of the data (assertions),\n–\nProvides many of the main features necessary to express conceptual models (UML class \ndiagrams and ER diagrams). \n–\nIt contains the intersection of RDFS and OWL 2 DL.\n•\nOWL2 RL\n–\nInspired by Description Logic Programs and pD*. \n–\nSyntactic subset of OWL 2 which is amenable to implementation using rule-based technologies, \nand presenting a partial axiomatization of the OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics in the form of \nfirst-order implications that can be used as the basis for such an implementation. \n–\nScalable reasoning without sacrificing too much expressive power. \n–\nDesigned for\n•\nOWL applications trading the full expressivity of the language for efficiency, \n•\nRDF(S) applications that need some added expressivity from OWL 2. \n",
