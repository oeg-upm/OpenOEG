  "message": "SYSTEM: PROLEGintro_eng_long.pdf: Página 31\nWorking Example(continued)\nTo handle the above case, we take into account the Japanese Civil\nCode Article 612,\n• Phrase 1 states that a lessee may not assign the lessee’s rights\nor sublease a leased thing without obtaining the approval of the\nlessor, and\n• Phrase 2 states that if the lessee allows any third party to make use\nof or take proﬁts from a leased thing in violation of the provisions\nof the preceding paragraph, the lessor may cancel the contract.\nHowever, according to the Supreme Court case rule, Phrase 2 is not\napplicable in exceptional situations where the sublease does not harm\nthe conﬁdence between a lessee and a lessor, and therefore the lessor\ncannot cancel the contract unless they prove the lessee’s destructin of\nconﬁdence.\n31\n",
