Relation with the Rest of WPs within Project \nThe relation between this deliverable and the other parts of WPs in the NeOn project is briefly \ndescribed below: \n The NeOn Glossary of Activities includes activities related to the research being carried out in \nWP1 (e.g., ontology evolution), WP2 (e.g., ontology localization), WP3 (e.g., ontology aligning), \nand WP4 (e.g., ontology customization).  \n FAO, iSOCO, and ATOS as leaders of the use case WPs (WP7 and WP8, respectively) \nreviewed the NeOn Glossary of Activities from their practical point of view.  \n The work carried out in WP7 and WP8 and their initial ideas for developing ontologies provide \na useful feedback for methodological guidelines. \n Methodological guidelines for building ontology networks were provided to the two use cases in \nWP8.  \n \n  \n \n2006–2007 © Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions. \n \n",
