Espinoza\n29\nOntological Engineering\nPatterns\nPattern is something proposed for imitation.\nDesign Pattern refers to shared guidelines that help solve design problems.\nOntology Design Pattern (ODP) is a modeling solution to solve a recurrent ontology\ndesign problem.\nOur concept of “pattern” is associable with the wider “good/best practice” of software\nengineering.
