Such guidelines are \nmainly based on two decision trees: one for selecting the ontology network life cycle model \nmost appropriate for the concrete case and another for selecting which activities, from the \nNeOn Glossary of Activities, should be carried out. \n Application of the contributions of this deliverable in two NeOn use cases (invoicing \nmanagement and nomenclature ontology networks). \n \nAfter the first step forward in the way of making progress the degree of maturity in the Ontology \nEngineering field presented in this deliverable, future methodological work (methods, techniques \nand tools for a selected set of activities in the NeOn Glossary of Activities) for continuing the \nadvance will be included in D5.4.1 (NeOn methodology for building contextualized networked \nontologies) at M24, with emphasis on pattern-based conceptualization, reengineering and reuse. \nDeeper evaluations of the different ontology network life cycle models proposed and of the \nproposed guidelines in this deliverable will be carried out within task T5.6 (Evaluation of the NeOn \nmethodologies) and will be included in deliverable D5.6.1 (Experimentation with NeOn \nmethodologies) at M24. \nThe next version of this deliverable (D5.3.2 due to M36) will include a revision and an update of the \npresented work based on the experiments carried out in T5.6. And also we will include new models \nand guidelines based on the newest methodologies in Software Engineering. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",
