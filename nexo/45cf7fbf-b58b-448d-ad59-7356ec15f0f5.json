Seven-phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model \n Seven-phase + merging phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model. \nThis model, extended from the previous one and shown in Figure 32, includes the Merging \nPhase after the reuse if the development team is reusing ontologies or ontology modules. \nAdditionally, this model allows going into the merging phase for merging the reengineered \nresources after reengineering knowledge resources (ontological and not ontological). \nFor the other phases the requirements are the same as those presented in the previous model. \n \nFigure 32. Seven-phase + merging phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model  \n5.1.2. Incremental Ontology Network Life Cycle Model \nThe main feature of this proposed model (as that of its homonymous in Section 2.3.3) is to divide \nthe requirements in different parts and then develop each part in a different cycle. The idea is to \n“produce and deliver” the network of ontologies in increments (full developed and functional).  \nThis model assumes that the overall requirements are well-known at the begin of the development. \nIn incremental models, however, a limited set of requirements is allocated to each increment and \nwith each successive release more requirements are addressed until the final release satisfies all \nrequirements. \n \n",
