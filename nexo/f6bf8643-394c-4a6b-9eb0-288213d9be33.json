However, the improving of the design, execution and analysis of the OAEI's evaluations requires the support of the SEALS methodology\nWhich is the research value of the two methodologies? Which are the expected research outcomes?\nIs it feasible to develop the two methodologies with the expected effort in time? ([FRM]: Yes if we acknowledge that it is not possible to cover all methodology aspects in detail) ([Ra√∫l] What are we going to cover?)\nHow will we ensure that the methodologies are used in the consortium? [FRM]: Being pragmatic in the design of the SEALS methodology and taking into account inputs from the SEALS consortium and the participants in the 1st evaluation campaign)",
