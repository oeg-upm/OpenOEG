Based on that, \nthe following groups are proposed:  \n(a) Ontology Management Activity \n(b) Ontology Pre-Development Activity \n(c) Ontology Development Activity  \n(d) Ontology Post-Development Activity \n(e) Ontology Support Activity \nThe type for a concrete activity should be unique \nInput \nA list of the required information to be input of the activity \nOutput \nA list of the information that is required to be output of the \nactivity \nReferences \nReferences for the NL definitions \nComments \nOther comments about the activity \n \n3. To create an initial list of activities with definitions. An initial NeOn Glossary of Activities (initial \nidentification and definition of the main activities to be included in the ontology network \ndevelopment process) was made available in the wiki following the template presented in Table \n1. The initial glossary was created using as starting point the ontology activities found in the \nfollowing sources: METHONTOLOGY [32], On-To-Knowledge [53], DILIGENT [47], NeOn use \ncases [37, 30], the Semantic Web Framework (SWF) from Knowledge Web Network of \nExcellence7 [28], and inputs from papers and ontology experts, as can be seen in Figure 14. \nThe initial list of activities, definitions and grouping contained 39 activities, and they were \nuploaded on the wiki in mid-June 2006. \n                                                 \n7 http://knowledgeweb.semanticweb.org/ \n",
