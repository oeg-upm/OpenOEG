Then, the user can accept the\nﬁrst proposed ontology term (the most probable one) or may choose another one in the\nlist, and move to the next model term to ground it.\nIn order to save time and effort, a more automatic way of operating is allowed,\ncalled whole model grounding (see Figure 4). This way, the whole model is grounded\nat once, and only the most probable grounding of each term is shown to the user (sepa-\nrated by types of model ingredients: entities, quantities, etc.). If the user is not satisﬁed\nwith some default grounding, he/she can ask for other proposals and the whole list of\ncandidate senses is shown.\nFig. 4. Example of model grounding (left). When the user asks for alternative groundings for the\nterm “death rate”, the window on the right appears.\nIn case that the term to be grounded is not well covered by the proposed groundings\n(the user is not satisﬁed, or no sense was found), two actions are possible:\n1. We obtain from WordNet [25] syntactic variations of the initial word, as well as\napproximate forms coming from Yahoo Spelling Suggestion Service6. These al-\nternative terms are offered to the user for grounding, thus increasing the range of\npossibilities.\n2. The user can insert the “ungroundable” term anyway, hence generating a new ontol-\nogy term that is added into an ontology of anchor terms. This way, the information\n6 http://developer.yahoo.com/search/web/V1/spellingSuggestion.html\n",
