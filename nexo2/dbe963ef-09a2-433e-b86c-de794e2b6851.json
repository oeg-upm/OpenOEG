It is important to “be there”.\n\nPoster presentation of projects (great dissemination oportunity)\n\nNot only NLP… people interested in ontologies!\n\nSelf-promotion strategy from Hitz, we should learn!\n\nPeople with t-shirts from their lab… we need pins or something!\nOUTCOMES\n\nContacts from several NLP companies.\n\nDissinformation group.\n\nNext year we should go ALL TOGETHER (Valladolid, close!)\n7\n",
