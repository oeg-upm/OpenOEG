Pitfall “P22.Using different naming criteria in the ontology” \nName \nP22. Using different naming criteria in the ontology \nDescription \nThis pitfall consists in not following any naming convention when providing an identifier to the ontology \nelements. \nRecommendation \nA possible lightweight recommendation is to name the ontology elements following these rules: \n \nAll words in a class identifier start with capital letter and follow with lowercase. \n \nThe first word in properties (relationships and attributes) is written with lowercases and the other words \nstart with capital letter and follow with lowercase. \n \nIndividuals follow the same rule that properties unless they are name entities. \nExample \nIn the non-recommended scenario, we can observe two criteria to name classes within  an ontology on food. \nOn the one hand, “Ingredient” stars with capital letters; on the other hand, its subclasses start with \nlowercases. Additionally, some class names are written with the “s” of the  plural. \nIn the recommended scenario we have renamed all subclasses of “Ingredient” following the \nrecommendation proposed above for classes. Also, we have changed the plural identifiers  into singular  \nidentifiers. \nNot Recommended \nRecommended \n \n \n",
