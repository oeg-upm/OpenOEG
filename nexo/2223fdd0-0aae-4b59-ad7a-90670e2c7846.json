For this search, we have to deﬁne the following\nsearch criteria:\n– Type of non-ontological resource: thesaurus.\n– Type of thesaurus: term-based thesaurus or concept-based thesaurus.\n– Data model: record-based, or relation-based.\n– Target ontology: lightweight ontology.\n– The semantics of the BT/NT relations between thesaurus terms: subClassOf, parOf, or other\nad-hoc relation.\n• Task 5.a. Use patterns for re-engineering to guide the transformation. The goal of this task is to\napply the re-engineering pattern obtained in task 4 to transform the thesaurus into a conceptual model.\nIf a suitable pattern for re-engineering thesaurus is found then the conceptual model is created from\nthe thesaurus following the procedure established in the re-engineering pattern.\n• Task 5.b. Perform and ad-hoc transformation. The goal of this task is to set up an ad-hoc procedure\nto transform the thesaurus into a conceptual model, when a suitable pattern for re-engineering was not\nfound. This ad-hoc procedure may be generalized to create a new pattern for re-engineering thesaurus.\n• Task 5.c. Manual reﬁnement. We add this task for dealing with thesauri transformation. Within this\ntask, software developers and ontology practitioners with the domain experts support can perform the\nfollowing reﬁnements:\n– Some related term relations can be transformed into more speciﬁc kinds of relations.\n– If there will be the case where some BT ambiguous relations are present. These BT relations\ncan be disambiguated. They may mean either subClassOf, partOf or instanceOf.\n2http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org\n2006–2008 c⃝Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions.\n",
