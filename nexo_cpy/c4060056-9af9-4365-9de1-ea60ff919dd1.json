If base is not defined, \nit defaults to 10. \nconvert(string sourceCharset, string \ntargetCharset) \nConverts the string from “sourceCharset” to “targetCharset” \ntokenize([regex]) \nSplits the string into tokens. Splits at all matches of “regex” if \nprovided and at whitespaces otherwise. \nremoveValues(blacklist) \nRemoves specific values (i.e. stop words) from the value set. \n‘blacklist’ is a comma-separated list of words. \nOperators: comparators \n14 \n•  A comparison operator evaluates two inputs and \ncomputes the similarity based on a user-defined \ndistance measure and a user-defined threshold. \n•  The distance measure always outputs 0 for a perfect \nmatch, and a higher value for an imperfect match.  \n•  Only distance values between 0 and threshold will \nresult in a positive similarity score.  \n•  Therefore it is important to know how the distance \nmeasures work and what the range of their output \nvalues is in order to set a threshold value sensibly. \n \n",
