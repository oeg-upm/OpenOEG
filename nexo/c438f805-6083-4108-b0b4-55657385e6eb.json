In the context of this deliverable we deﬁne provenance as the reference to the\nnon-ontological resource component for every generated ontology element, e.g., class, property, etc.\nFor instance, an ontology attribute holds the reference to the non-ontological resource component.\n2.2.2\nCharacteristics of the Transformation Process\nThis section presents the identiﬁed characteristics that are related to the transformation process. This section\nis divided in speciﬁc and general characteristics.\n• Speciﬁc characteristics\n– The transformation process follows either (1) a one-step transformation of the resource, that is,\nit converts the overall non-ontological resource into an ontology, or (2) an incremental transfor-\nmation, that is, it converts speciﬁc components of the resource into an ontology, without applying\na whole transformation.\n– The transformation process follows the transformation approach of (1) transforming the re-\nsource schema into an ontology schema, and the resource content, into ontology instances; (2)\ntransforming the resource content into an ontology schema; or (3) transforming the resource con-\ntent into instances of an existing ontology. Figure 2.2 depicts each of the possible transformation\napproaches.\nFigure 2.2: Transformation approaches\n– The transformation process can be (1) automatic, (2) semi-automatic or (3) manual.\n",
