DAML ontology is implemented in OWL. \nSelecting Currency classification \nThe following non-exhaustive list presents some examples of currency classifications: \nPacific Exchange Rate Service14  \nISO 421715\nWordAtlas16\nWe choose the ISO 4217 currency names and code elements. \nSelecting geographic location classification \nThe following non-exhaustive list presents some examples of geographic location \nclassifications: \n• \nISO 316617 Maintenance agency (ISO 3166/MA) – ISO's focal point for country \ncodes. \n                                                 \n6 http://www.cyc.com/cyc-2-1/cover.html \n7 http://ontology.ip.rm.cnr.it/onto/ON9.3-OL-HTML/unrestricted-time/ \n8 http://www-ksl-svc.stanford.edu/ \n9 http://www.kestrel.edu/DAML/2000/12/TIME.daml \n10 http://www.ai.sri.com/daml/ontologies/sri-basic/1-0/Time.daml \n11 http://www.ontologyportal.org/ \n12 http://cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/daml/time-page.html \n13 http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/dor/akt/akt.html \n14 http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/currency_table.html \n15 http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/popstds/currencycodeslist.html \n16 http://worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/currency.htm \n",
