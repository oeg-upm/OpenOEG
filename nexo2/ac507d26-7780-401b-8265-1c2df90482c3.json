Activities carried out for building the ontology network \nThe aim underlying the Nomenclature ontology network is to describe pharmaceutical information \nbased on the different medical languages and thesaurus and on the data coming from the Spanish \npharmaceutical databases and resources. \nIn this sense, the Nomenclature ontology network has been developed following the schemata of \nthe main sources of information on drugs in Spain: Integra, Digitalis, BOTPlus and in the ATC \nClassification. Furthermore, this Nomenclature ontology network is networked with some common \nontologies, such as Time ontology, Measure ontology, Geographical ontology and Laboratory \nontology. The Nomenclature Ontology Network is connected via mappings to ontologies that \n \n",
