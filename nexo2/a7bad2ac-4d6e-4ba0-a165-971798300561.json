In this section we present the existing data models for classiﬁcation schemes. In order to\nexemplify the data models for classiﬁcation schemes, we use an excerpt from the FAO classiﬁcation scheme\nof water areas2 presented in Figure 4.2.\nFigure 4.2: Excerpt of the Water Area classiﬁcation scheme.\nPath Enumeration Data Model\nA path enumeration data model [Bra05] is a recursive structure for hierarchy representations deﬁned as\na model which stores for each node the path (as a string) from the root to the node. This string is the\nconcatenation of the nodes code in the path from the root to the node. In other words, every classiﬁcation\nscheme item has unique code (i.e. a key value), distinguishing it from the others. Also, every classiﬁcation\nscheme item has a path, consisting of the concatenated unique string codes of all the parents, until the root.\nFigure 4.3 illustrates this data model.\n2http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/RefServlet\n",
