The evaluation output is displayed in Table 6.2. This would result\nto {CORRECT, INCORRECT, MIXED, UNDETERMINED, NON ENRICHED}. According to this table, 179\nenrichments (about 80%) were {CORRECT}, i.e., all the enriched tags of the photo are enriched correctly.\nNote that the {CORRECT} enrichment results are much higher from a photo-centric perspective as many\ntags may appear in many photos. For the total of 20 {INCORRECT} and {MIXED} enrichments, 3 of the\nphotos had all enriched tags incorrect and 17 had at least one tag incorrectly enriched. Finally the above 4\n{UNDETERMINED} tags resulted to 4 {UNDETERMINED} enrichments. Finally if no enriched tag appears in\nthe photo then the result for the photo is {NON ENRICHED}.\n",
