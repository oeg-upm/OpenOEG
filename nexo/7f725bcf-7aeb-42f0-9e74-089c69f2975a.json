It does not provide the resource provenance information, so the\nresultant ontology does not keep the reference to the ﬂat ﬁle.\nThe method for transforming ASC X12 messages into ontologies consists in\n– Syntactic transformation. In this step it is necessary to deﬁne and encode a vocabulary, i.e. create\na set of classes, for specifying the formats of Transaction Sets, Data Segments, Data Elements\nand Code Sets.\n– Semantic transformation. In this step it is possible to create separated ontologies for different\nTransaction Sets. Also classes or individuals are created for each Data Element Code that is\napplicable for the chosen group of Transaction Sets. Classes or relations are created for each\napplicable Data Element. Relations or rules are created for each Data segment.\nThe method produces several ontologies. The ontology components generated are classes, at-\ntributes, relations, and instances and they are expressed in OWL Full, CycL, and WSML\n2.3.3\nComparison of the Methods\nTables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 show the methods presented according to the characteristics related to the non-\nontological resource, the transformation process and the resultant ontology.\n",
