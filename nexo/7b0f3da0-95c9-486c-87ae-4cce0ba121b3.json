Six-phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model \n Six-phase + merging phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model.  \nFigure 30 shows the proposed model, which is a special case of the previous one. In the \nmodel, a new phase (the merging one) is added after the reuse one. This Merging Phase has \nas a requirement to obtain a new ontology from two or more ontologies selected in the reuse \nphase.  \nFor the other phases the requirements are the same as those presented in the previous model. \n \nFigure 30. Six-phase + merging phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model  \n Seven-phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model. \nIn this model, shown in Figure 31, the six-phase model is taken as general basis and a new \nphase (Reengineering Phase) is included after the reuse one. This model allows reusing \nknowledge resources (ontological and non ontological) and their later reengineering. In this \nmodel the reuse phase has as output one or more knowledge resources to be reused in the \nontology network that is being developed. After this phase, the non ontological resources are \nreengineered in the reengineering phase; on the other hand, the ontological resources can or \ncannot be reengineered (this is decided by the development team). \nFor the other phases the requirements are the same as those presented in the previous model. \n",
