LT SMEs developing collaboration strategies are advised not to play in more than\none space on the map. While not strictly rigorous, the three styles map roughly to the “direction” a collab‐\noration may take.\nAsymmetric partnering for SMEs is a natural route to developing technologies in specialist areas with steep\ntechnical demands (heavy R&D), where domain expertise is key. Opportunities in verticals (high end finan‐\ncial systems, oil & gas exploration, pharmaceutical research) may be found through partnerships with spe‐\ncialist companies already active in those domains. LT developers innovate by applying new technology to\nknown problems, or addressing business challenges in new ways.\nPeer partnering takes the alternate route of creating new “breakout” categories of products or services\nthrough the collaborative combination of complementary technologies. Opportunities in the emerging\nsocial/mobile ecosystem tend toward this quadrant, though Peer Ecosystems could be developed for virtu‐\nally any market area.\nDominant markets are those where technical depth meets the greatest opportunity. Leveraging the capaci‐\nties of open platforms could enable niche companies to participate in markets that are otherwise dominat‐\ned by much larger players.\nThese scenarios will be used as a basis for exploring collaborative opportunities within LT‐Innovate, and out‐\nside the network with potential partners in projects.\nFigure 18: Mapping Scenarios\n",
