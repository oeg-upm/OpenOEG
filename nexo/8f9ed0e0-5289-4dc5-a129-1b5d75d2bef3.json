They \naddress content problems. \n(E.g. Agent-Role) \nLogical ODPs are formal expressions, whose \nonly parts are expressions from a logical \nvocabulary e.g., OWL DL, that solve a problem \nof expressivity \nLogical ODPs are independent from a specific \ndomain of interest, i.e. they are content-\nindependent \nLogical ODPs solve design problems where the \nprimitives of the representation language do not \ndirectly support certain logical constructs \n(E.g., N-Ary Relation) \n",
