Examples (I)\n•\nSample RDF graph\n“Oscar Corcho García”\nperson:hasName\n•\nQuery: “Tell me who are the persons who have Asun as a\noeg:Oscar\noeg:Asun\noeg:Raúl\n“http://www.fi.upm.es/”\nperson:hasHomePage\nperson:hasColleague\nperson:hasColleague\n•\nQuery: Tell me who are the persons who have Asun as a \ncolleague”\n•\nResult: oeg:Oscar and oeg:Raúl\n?\noeg:Asun\nperson:hasColleague\n41\n",
