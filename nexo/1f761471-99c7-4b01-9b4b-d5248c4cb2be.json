INTEGRATING THE ONTOLOGY TO BE \nREUSED \nLinks between terms of the reused ontology and the ontology to be developed should be established. \nTo answer CQ4 (with which substances does Frenadol® interact?) we have added this rule to the ontology: \ninteractsWith(?x, ?y), part(?x, ?z) -> interactsWith(?z, ?y)  \nWe have added the axioms identified in task 1.1 (e.g. isMainActiveIngredient is subrelation of isPartOf)  \n",
