A direct implementation would be as tables in a relational database\nor in a spreadsheet. Figure 5.4.4 presents a spreadsheet implementation of the record-based model of a\nterm-based thesaurus, and Figure 5.4.4 presents an XML implementation of the record-based model of a\nterm-based thesaurus. Both ﬁgures present the same excerpt of the AGROVOC thesaurus represented in\ndifferent implementations.\nFigure 5.7: Spreadsheet implementation of the record-based\nmodel of a term-based thesaurus\nFigure 5.8: XML implementation of the record-based model\nof a term-based thesaurus\nFigure 5.9 shows how a given type of thesauri can be modeled following one or more data models, each of\nwhich could be implemented in different ways at the implementation layer. As an example, Figure 5.9 shows\na term-based thesaurus modeled following a record-based model. In this case, the thesaurus is implemented\nin a database and in an XML ﬁle.\n2006–2008 c⃝Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions.\n",
