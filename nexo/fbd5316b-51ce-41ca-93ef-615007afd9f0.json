It refers to whether the ontology has been built according to the design criteria \nassumed by the development team of the domain ontology. \n\u0002 \nAvailability of tests. It refers to whether tests are available for the candidate ontology to be \nreused. \n\u0002 \nFormer evaluation. it refers to whether  the ontology has been properly evaluated, which here \nmeans that there is  a set of unit tests that the ontology passed.  \n\u0002 \nTheoretical support. It refers to whether the candidate ontology is supported by a contrasted \ntheory. \n\u0002 \nDevelopment team reputation.

It refers to whether the candidate ontology has been developed as a simple \nacademic example. \n\u0002 \nPractical support.
