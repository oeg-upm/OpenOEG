We ﬁrst deﬁne the relational schema that represents\nthe so-called concepts, i.e., entities, relationships and attributes, of an ER+ schema\nC as follows: (i) each entity E in C has an associated predicate e/1; intuitively, e(c)\nasserts that c is an instance of entity E, (ii) each attribute A of an entity E in C has\nan associated predicate a/2; intuitively, a(c,d) asserts that d is the value of attribute\nA (of some entity E) associated to c, where c is an instance of E, (iii) each rela-\ntionship R of arity n in C has an associated predicate r/n; intuitively, r(c1,...,cn)\nasserts that ⟨c1,...,cn⟩is an instance of relationship R (among entities E1,...,En),\nwhere c1,...,cn are instances of E1,...,En, respectively, and (iv) each attribute A of\na relationship R of arity n in C has an associated predicate a/(n + 1); intuitively,\na(c1,...,cn,d) asserts that d is the value of attribute A (of some relationship R of\narity n) associated to the instance ⟨c1,...,cn⟩of R.\nExample 1.3. Consider the ER+ schema C given in Example 1.2. The relational\nschema R associated to C consists of the predicates member/1, phd student/1,\nprofessor/1, group/1, works in/2, leads/2, memb name/2, stud gpa/2, gr name/2,\nsince/3. Note that queries over an ER+ schema are queries over the rela-\ntional schema associated to it. The CQ p(B) ←phd student(A),memb name(A,B),\nworks in(A,C),since(A,C,2006),gr name(C,db) asks for the names of the students\nwho work in the “db” group since 2006.\nOnce we have deﬁned the relational schema R for an ER+ schema C , we give\nthe semantics of each construct of C . We do that by using the dependencies intro-\nduced in Subsection 1.2.3, as shown in Table 1.2 (the relationships have arity n).\n",
