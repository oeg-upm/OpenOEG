In some disciplines, reproduction of results by others is a basic research activity. We would like to encourage researchers to reproduce and validate methods, results and experiments etc. proposed by others before in a new context or application, on new datasets, under new assumptions etc. The goal is clearly to reach interesting and significant new conclusions about the method/approach in question that warrant a stand-alone publication. The reproduction of results should thus lead to new knowledge about the method in question or reveal inherent problems in the assumptions of the original research or limitations of previous solutions. Papers will be evaluated with respect to the soundness of the rationale for reproducing a certain approach as well as with respect to the new knowledge that is generated by reproducing the approach in question. A clear comparison between the results obtained through the reproduction and the original results are mandatory.",
