The \nmore information a search result snippet can provide, the easier it is for users to decide \nwhether that page is relevant to their search. With rich snippets, webmasters with sites \ncontaining structured content—for example, review sites or business listings—can label their \ncontent to make it clear that each labeled piece of text represents a certain type of data: for \nexample, a restaurant name, an address, or a rating. This information doesn't affect the \nappearance of your content on your own pages, but it does help Google better understand and \npresent information from your page. \n \n",
