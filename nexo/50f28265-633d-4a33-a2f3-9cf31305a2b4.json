They are used to calculate the sum of difference between two items.  \nPlus/min relations can be the target or source of an inequality relation. There are nine \ndifferent ways plus/min relations can be used, depending on the type of the two items \nrelated by it. Table 3 shows the possible uses of plus/min relations between magnitude \nitems, while Table 4 shows the possibilities between derivative items. Note that the type \nof a plus/min relation from A to B is considered the same type (i.e. has the same \nnumber) as an inequality from B to A. \n \n1. From a magnitude to another magnitude. \n2. From a point belonging to the quantity space of a magnitude, to a point belonging \nto the quantity space of another magnitude. \n3. From a plus/min relation between magnitude items, to another plus/min relation \nbetween magnitude items. \n4. From a magnitude to a point belonging to the quantity space of a magnitude.  \n5. Between a magnitude and a plus/min relation between magnitude items. \n6. Between a point belonging to the quantity space of a magnitude and a plus/min \nrelation between magnitude items. \n7. From a derivative to another derivative. \n8. Between a plus/min relation between derivative items and another plus/min \nrelation between derivative items. \n9. Between a derivative and a plus/min relation between derivative items. \n \nTable 3: The possible plus/min relations between magnitude items \nTo \nFrom \nMagnitude \nPoint (Magnitude) \nPlus/Min \n(Magnitude) \nMagnitude \n1 \n4 \n5 \nPoint (Magnitude) \n4 \n2 \n6 \nPlus/Min \n(Magnitude) \n5 \n6 \n3 \n \n \n",
