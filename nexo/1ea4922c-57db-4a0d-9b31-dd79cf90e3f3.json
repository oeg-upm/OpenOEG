Basic Inference Tasks\n•\nSubsumption – check knowledge is correct (captures intuitions)\n– Does C subsume D w.r.t. ontology O? (in every model I of O, CI DI )\n•\nEquivalence – check knowledge is minimally redundant (no unintended \nsynonyms)\n– Is C equivalent to D w.r.t. O? (in every model I of O, CI = DI )\n•\nConsistency – check knowledge is meaningful (classes can have instances)\n– Is C satisfiable w.r.t. O? (there exists some model I of O s.t. CI )\n•\nInstantiation and querying\n– Is x an instance of C w.r.t. O? (in every model I of O, xI CI )\n– Is (x,y) an instance of R w.r.t. O? (in every model I of O, (xI,yI) RI )\n•\nAll reducible to KB satisfiability or concept satisfiability w.r.t. a KB\n•\nCan be decided using highly optimised tableaux reasoners\n",
