Furthermore, based on different linguistic revision and on Q.A. comments some agreed \ndefinitions have been slightly modified.  \nSo, in this section we present the NeOn Glossary of Activities (version 1), ordered \nalphabetically, which includes 53 activities.  \nNote that some of the activities have maintained their definition taken from the literature (as it is \nshown in the list bellow). This is the case of, for example: ontology configuration management, \nontology evolution, and ontology formalization.  \nFor most of the activities the definition have been changed and adapted based on past definitions \nexisting in the literature and based on NeOn partners comments and discussions. This is the case \nof, for example, ontology conceptualization, ontology documentation, ontology matching, and \nontology selection. \nNew activities and definitions have been created during the consensus building process, either \nbecause the activity did not yet exist in the literature or because the activity had no definition in the \nliterature. This is the case of the following activities: ontology annotation, ontology comparison, \nontology customization, ontology diagnosis, ontology elicitation, ontology enrichment, ontology \nextension, ontology learning, ontology localization, ontology module extraction, ontology \npartitioning, non ontological resource reengineering, ontology repair, non ontological resource \nreuse, ontology search, and ontology upgrade.  \n Ontology Aligning refers to the activity of finding the correspondences between two or more \nontologies and storing/exploiting them. A synonym for this activity is Ontology Mapping. \n \n Ontology Annotation refers to the activity of enriching the ontology with additional \ninformation, e.g. metadata or comments. \n Ontology Assessment refers to the activity of checking an ontology against user \nrequirements, such as usability, usefulness, abstraction, quality, etc. \n Ontology Comparison refers to the activity of finding differences between two or more \nontologies or between two or more ontology modules. \n Ontology Conceptualization refers to the activity of organizing and structuring the information \n(data, knowledge, etc.), obtained during the acquisition process, into meaningful models at the \nknowledge level according to the ontology specification document. This activity is independent \nof the way in which the ontology implementation will be carried out. \n Ontology Configuration Management  [32] refers to the activity of recording all the versions \nof the documentation, software and ontology code, and of controling the changes. \n Control [32] refers to the activity of guaranteeing that scheduled activities in the ontology \ndevelopment process are completed in the manner intended to be performed. \n Ontology Customization refers to the activity of adapting an ontology to a specific user's \nneeds. \n Ontology Diagnosis refers to the activity of identifying parts of the ontology directly \nresponsible for incorrectness and incompleteness. Ontology diagnosis is triggered by ontology \nvalidation. \n Ontology Documentation refers to the collection of documents and explanatory comments \ngenerated during the entire ontology building process. \nNote: Examples of documents external to the implemented ontology include ontology \nspecification documents, sources used for acquiring knowledge, ontology conceptualization \ndocument, design and decision criteria, ontological commitments, etc. \n",
