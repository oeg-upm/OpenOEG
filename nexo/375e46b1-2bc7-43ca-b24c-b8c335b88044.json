Main ad-hoc relationships between the modular ontologies. \n \nNext we provide the conceptualization of the mentioned ontologies. \n• Job Seeker Ontology. This ontology models knowledge of job seeker and CV \ninformation used in the SEEMP Project. The Job Seeker Ontology imports \nconcepts from the education ontology, language ontology, economic activity \nontology, compensation ontology, geography ontology, driving license ontology, \nlabour regulatory ontology and skill ontology, and these imported concepts are \nused to connect the Job Seeker Ontology with the other ontologies. Error! \nReference source not found. shows all the ad hoc relationships whose domain is \na concept belonging to the Job Seeker Ontology (concepts of the Job Seeker \nOntology are drawn in yellow). Examples of the relationships can be: ‘Job \nSeeker has driving license Driving License’ (with the Driving \nLicense concept from the Driving License Ontology), ‘Job Seeker has \neducation Education’ (with the Education concept from the Education \nOntology), ‘Job Seeker has mother tongue Language’ (with the \nLanguage concept from the Language Ontology), etc. \n• Job Offer Ontology. This ontology models knowledge of job vacancy, employer \nand job offer information used in the SEEMP Project. The Job Offer Ontology \nimports concepts from the education ontology, language ontology, economic \nactivity ontology, compensation ontology, geography ontology, driving license \nontology, labour regulatory ontology and skill ontology, and these imported \nconcepts are used to connect the Job Offer Ontology with the other ontologies. \n",
