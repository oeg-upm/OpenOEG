This has the potential of being a valuable Web resource for scientiﬁc\nprogress in general and for semantic guided learning in particular.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the topic of quali-\ntative reasoning. In Section 3 a method for expressing QR models in OWL is presented.\nSection 4 describes the semantic grounding process. Quality feedback from stored mod-\nels is described in Section 5. Section 6 describes our experimental results. In Section 7\nsome related work is presented. Conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 8.\n2\nQualitative Modelling and Simulation\nThe functionality presented in this paper is implemented in the DynaLearn3 Interac-\ntive Learning Environment (ILE) [4] (an evolution of Garp34 [5]), which implements a\ndiagrammatic approach to modelling and simulating qualitative models.\nDynaLearn allows modellers to capture their knowledge about the structure and\nthe important processes governing their system of interest. Generic knowledge about\nprocesses, such as how a process causally affects quantities and when it is active, are\nrepresented in Model Fragments (MFs). MFs incorporate other model ingredients as\neither conditions or consequences, and thus form a rule that, for example, indicates that\nif a population has a biomass above zero, the production will increase the biomass,\nwhile the mortality will decrease the biomass (Figure 2(b)).\nQR models can be simulated based on a scenario, which represents an initial situa-\ntion of the system (i.e. a particular variant of the system and a set of initial values for its\nquantities). The result of the simulation is a state graph in which each state represents\na qualitatively unique state of behaviour (i.e. the current structure of the system and\nquantities with particular values). The transitions represent how the system can change\nfrom one state of behaviour to others. To perform the simulation, MFs are sought that\nmatch the scenario (i.e. the model ingredients fulﬁl the conditions of the MF). The con-\nsequences of matching MFs are merged with the scenario to create an augmented state\nfrom which the next states of behaviour can be determined.\nModel ingredient deﬁnitions, or domain building blocks, are instantiated in MFs and\nscenarios, and are of particular importance for this paper. These deﬁnitions include enti-\nties, agents, assumptions, conﬁgurations, quantities and quantity spaces. Entities deﬁne\nthe concepts with which the structure of the system is described, e.g. environment and\npopulation. Entities are organized in a taxonomy. Figure 2(a) shows an entity hierarchy.\nAgents and assumptions are also deﬁned in taxonomies. Agents represent inﬂuences\nfrom outside the system (when a modeller decides these are not part of the system). As-\nsumptions represent simplifying or operating assumptions about the system, such as the\nassumption that resources for primary producers is considered constant. Conﬁgurations\ndeﬁne relationships with which the structural relations between entities are described.\nThey are deﬁned by their name (e.g. part of, contains, lives in). Quantities represent the\nfeatures of entities and agents that may change during simulation, and are deﬁned by\n3 http://www.dynalearn.eu\n4 http://www.garp3.org\n",
