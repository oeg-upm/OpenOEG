We can distinguish between: Ontology Elicitation, \nOntology Learning and Ontology Population. \n \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Learning is a knowledge acquisition activity that relies on (semi-) \nautomatic methods to transform unstructured (e.g. corpora), semi-structured (e.g. \nfolksonomies, html pages, etc.) and structured data sources (e.g. data bases) \ninto conceptual structures (e.g. T-Box).  \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Localization refers to the adaptation of an ontology to a particular \nlanguage and culture. \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Mapping refers to the activity of finding the correspondences between \ntwo or more ontologies and storing/exploiting them. A synonym for this activity is \nOntology Aligning. \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Matching refers to the activity of finding or discovering relationships or \ncorrespondences between entities of different ontologies or ontology modules. \nNote: Ontology Matching can be seen as the first stage of Ontology Aligning. \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Merging refers to the activity of creating a new ontology or ontology \nmodule from two or more, possibly overlapping, source ontologies or ontology \nmodules. \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Modification refers to the activity of changing the ontology, without \nconsidering the consistency. \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Modularization refers to the activity of identifying one or more \nmodules in an ontology with the purpose of supporting reuse or maintenance. \nNote: We can make distinctions between: Ontology Module Extraction and \nOntology Partitioning. \n \n",
