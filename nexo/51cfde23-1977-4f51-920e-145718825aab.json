Sharing code is \nnot considered as important. \n \n•The majority of responders found the workflow system useful. \n \n•Creating workflows is very useful, but the reuse of workflows was not seen as useful. \n \n•Workflows are useful for both nonprogrammers and for teaching new students. \n \n•Reusing groupings from one’s own work is more useful than reusing groupings from \nothers. Groupings help simplify workflows. Groupings save time and also make \nworkflows more understandable by others. \n \n•Workflows are not systematically linked to publications. Most responders believe \nthat the link between a workflow and a publication is kept in private laboratory notes \n \n \n20 \n",
