Because inequalities specify an order \nbetween items, they are sometimes referred to as ordinal relations. There are eleven \nways to use inequalities, depending on the type of the two items related by it. Table 1 \nshows the possible inequalities between magnitude items, while Table 2 shows them for \nderivative items. Note that the type of an inequality from A to B is considered the same \ntype (i.e. has the same number) as an inequality from B to A. \n \n1. From a magnitude to another magnitude. \n2. From a point belonging to the quantity space of a magnitude, to a point belonging \nto the quantity space of another magnitude. \n3. From a plus/min relation between magnitude items, to another plus/min relation \nbetween magnitude items. \n4. From a magnitude to a point belonging to the quantity space of a magnitude. The \nreverse is impossible. \n5. Between a magnitude and a plus/min relation between magnitude items. \n6. Between a point belonging to the quantity space of a magnitude and a plus/min \nrelation between magnitude items. \n7. From a derivative to another derivative. \n8. Between a plus/min relation between derivative items and another plus/min \nrelation between derivative items. \n9. From a derivative to a point belonging the quantity space of a derivative (i.e. \nzero). Note that the reverse is impossible. \n10. Between a derivative and a plus/min relation between derivative items. \n11. Between a point belonging to the quantity space of a derivative (i.e. zero) and a \nplus/min relation between derivative items. \n \nTable 1: The possible inequalities between magnitude items \nTo \nFrom \nMagnitude \nPoint (Magnitude) \nPlus/Min \n(Magnitude) \nMagnitude \n1 \n4 \n5 \nPoint (Magnitude) \nImpossible \n2 \n6 \nPlus/Min \n(Magnitude) \n5 \n6 \n3 \n \nTable 2: The possible inequalities between derivative items \nTo \nFrom \nDerivative \nPoint (Derivative) \nPlus/Min \n(Derivative) \nDerivative \n7 \n9 \n10 \nPoint (Derivative) \nImpossible \nImpossible \n11 \nPlus/Min (Derivative) \n10 \n11 \n8 \n \n \n \n",
