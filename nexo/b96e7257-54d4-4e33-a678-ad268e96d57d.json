The ''analysis \nphase goal'' is to evaluate the ontology technically, that is, to check that the \nhierarchy of the ontology and its classes, instances, relations and functions are \ncomplete (contain all the definitions required for the domain of chemical \nsubstances), consistent (there are no contradictions in the ontology and with \nrespect to the knowledge sources used), concise (there are no explicit and \nimplicit redundancies) and syntactically correct. The ''synthesis phase'' seeks to \ncorrect the ontology after the analysis phase and document any changes made. \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Repair refers to the activity of resolving errors (incompleteness, \nincorrecteness) in the ontology and it is triggered by ontology diagnosis. \n \n\u0001\u0002 Non Ontological Resource Reuse refers to taking available non ontological \nresources (data bases, controlled vocabularies, etc.) for the development of \nontologies.  \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Reuse refers to using an ontology or an ontology module in the \nsolution of different problems. Ontology reuse is the activity that allows employing \nan ontology or an ontology module in, for example, the development of new \nontologies, the development of different ontology-based applications, the activity \nof ontology aligning (as background knowledge), etc. \n\u0001\u0002 Ontology Reverse Engineering refers to the activity of outputting a possible \nconceptual model on the basis of the code in which the ontology is implemented. \n",
