If we plan to send it to the EKAW (or similar) the focus should be in the way of building the ontology and later its use in the ADMIRE project. If we gofor a more data centric/Grid conference the ontology building section should be smaller. Important on how users built their modules in for ADMIRE.\nIn this paper I want to write about the Platform ontology. What I want to write about it can be divided in two: how it was built and how it is being used.\nHow it was built: first, we analysed the needs of the project, which is mainly to represent the PEs. Then, talking to Dave and looking at the White Paper we produce an initial version which was extended later on. The ontology engineers built the ontology from the PEs specifications at the ADMIRE wiki. Finallt end users added their own PEs using a tutorial for creating their own PEs. Including composite PEs.\nHow it is used: it is used by the ADMIRE registry for locating PEs. Describe the whole process that a PE follows, from its creation in the PD to its update in the registry?\nLiangxiu's proposed structure:\nWhy we use semantic descriptions for PEs? The importence of them in ADMIRE\nHow we build an ontology for the architecture? based on requirements, experts point of view\nThe use case study (EURExpress)",
