(1995) have four main types of ontologies, which are dis-\ntinguished according to the purpose of the ontology. They actually give sev-\neral “dimensions which contribute to making the characteristics clear” (p. \n50), but these are described only for task and domain ontologies, and there-\nfore we have left them out in Figure 3. \nFigure 3: Ontologies according to Mizoguchi et al. (1995) \n \nContent ontologies are further subdivided into task, domain and general \nontologies depending on what they describe, and these are further subdivided, \nbut no criterion is given explicitly. \nVan Heijst et al. (1997) use two subdivision criteria at the top level, i.e. \nAMOUNT AND TYPE OF STRUCTURE and ISSUE OF THE CONCEP-\nTUALIZATION. In Figure 4 these criteria are abbreviated. The use of two \ncriteria will make it possible to locate for example a terminological domain \nontology in the diagram. \n \n \n5\n",
