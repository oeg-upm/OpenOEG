The user interface is shown in Fig. 4\nFig. 4: UpGrid Control Point user interface.\n5.1\nMetadata generation\nThe process of generating metadata for multimedia resources is based on state-\nof-the-art techniques for resource description. The user interface of our Enhanced\nControl Point allows browsing through local or remote accessible multimedia re-\nsources, and provides ontology-based annotations for them. During the process\nof annotation, users can add RDF triples either directly or by means of per-\nforming searches over the Web of Linked Data. For instance, when annotating\na song from an album, the user can search for information about the song, al-\nbum, artist, etc., which will be sending SPARQL queries to various SPARQL\nendpoints (DBPedia, MusicBrainz, BBC, etc.) and select triples from the results\nthat allow linking these descriptions to existing URIs, or copying triples into the\nmetadata being generated.\n5.2\nMetadata management\nWe consider metadata as a \u001crst class entity in our architecture, in a similar\nway to what multimedia resources or devices are, with its own lifetime prop-\nerties and authorization mechanisms, and with strong links to the multimedia\n",
