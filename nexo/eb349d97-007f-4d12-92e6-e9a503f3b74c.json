Methodologies I (Asun)\nThe objective of this lecture is to show scenarios for the construction of ontologies, and provide methods and tools to create the ontology requirement specification, the search of potential resources to be reused, the selection of the ontology life cycle model and planning the ontology development.\nRecommended reading:\nNeOn Glossary of Activities\nD5.4.1.

For this purpose, such a committee needs an ontology network able to model information about the sports (summer and winter), about countries and teams involved, about venues and dates, and about medals and winners. Each group should focus on winter or summer sports; and should select one particular sport to define it in more detail.\nWrite the ontology requirement specification document (ORSD) using the methodological guidelines and the provided material, and documenting in detail the decisions taken.\nUse FreeMind Software for writting the competence questions\n[10]\nThe template for writting the ORSD (ontology requirement specification document):\nORSD Template\nQuick search for non-ontological resources in internet and ontologies using Watson that could be reused during the ontology development.\nSchedule the ontology network development using the gOntt plugin included in the NeOn toolkit.\nDeadline: 1/12/2009\nFill in the questionnaire\n[11]\nregarding the guideliness related with ontology requirement specification.\nDo the same\n[12]\nabout the gOntt plug-in.\n2/12/2009.
