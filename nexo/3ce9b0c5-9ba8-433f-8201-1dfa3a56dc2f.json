Corcho, MC Suárez de Figueroa Baonza\n23\nOWL and SWRL\nProperty Restrictions\nA restriction describes an anonymous class (an unnamed class). The anonymous\nclass contains all of the individuals that satisfy the restriction (i.e. all of the\nindividuals that have the relationships required to be a member of the class).\nRestrictions are used in OWL class descriptions to specify anonymous superclasses of the\nclass being described.\nExistential restrictions describe classes of individuals that participate in at least\none relationship along a specified property to individuals that are members of a\nspecified class.\nFor example, “the class of individuals that have at least one (some) hasTopping\nrelationship to members of MozzarellaTopping”.\nUniversal restrictions describe classes of individuals that for a given property\nonly have relationships along this property to individuals that are members of a\nspecified class.\nFor example, “the class of individuals that only have hasTopping relationships to\nmembers of VegetableTopping”.\n",
