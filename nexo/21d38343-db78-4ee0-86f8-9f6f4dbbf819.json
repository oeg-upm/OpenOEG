For this purpose, such a committee needs an ontology network able to model information about the sports (summer and winter), about countries and teams involved, about venues and dates, and about medals and winners. Each group should focus on winter or summer sports; and should select one particular sport to define it in more detail.\nWrite the ontology requirement specification document (ORSD) using the methodological guidelines and the provided material, and documenting in detail the decisions taken.\nQuick search for non-ontological resources in internet and ontologies using Watson that could be reused during the ontology development.\nSchedule the ontology network development.\nDeadline:\nExtended to 24/5/2009 23:00 CET\n5/5/2009.
