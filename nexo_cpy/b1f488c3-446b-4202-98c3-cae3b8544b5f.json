Mariano \nis also associate professor and Mari Carmen is teaching assistant” \n\n“Mariano and Mari Carmen co-participate at the CAEPIA 2007 conference”  \n\nThe goal of the ODPs reuse is  \n\nto facilitate the solution of modelling issues  \n\nto improve interoperability through using well-proven solutions and best practices, in the \nform of patterns \n\nThe idea of applying patterns for modelling ontologies was proposed by \n[Clark et al., 2000] \nOntology Design Patterns \nClark, P., Thompson, J., & Porter, B.
