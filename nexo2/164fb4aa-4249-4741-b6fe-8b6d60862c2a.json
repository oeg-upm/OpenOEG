A typical \ncase is that  in which the mereological relation \nappears in a composition of relations. \nTo reformulate the CQ so that the term is part \nof appears. \nCM1 and CM2 are fulfilled \nCsM6) We want to know which parts of object \no1 are not in object o2. \nTo reformulate the CQ so that the term are \ndisjoint appears. \nCM3 is fulfilled \nCsM7) We have applied CM3 in all the cases in \nwhich the condition has been fulfilled. \nTo introduce a linking axiom establishing that \nS is sub-relation of is part of. \n \n",
