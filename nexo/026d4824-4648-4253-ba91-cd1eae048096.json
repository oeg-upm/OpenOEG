Madeira October 5-8 2009 \n \n \npossible to attach information to concepts, such as \nreference documents (e.g. standards, schemas), \nreturns of experience, expert lists, etc. The result is a \nsoftware environment which is also used for learning \nand knowledge capitalisation. Access information \nrelies on the domain ontology and provides new \nways of interactive navigation like hyper schemas. \n5 CONCLUSION \nExperts require terminology which clearly \ndefines \nterms \nin \nrelation \nto \nthe \ndomain \nconceptualisation. Even if term definitions written in \nnatural language are useful, they are not always \nconsensual unlike domain conceptualisation. Experts \nalso require a terminology which is able to manage \nand preserve the diversity of language, for instance \nthe capability to use different words to denote the \nsame concept. \n \nWe \nhave \nintroduced \nthe \nparadigm \nof \nontoterminology, a terminology whose conceptual \nmodel is a formal ontology, in order to separate the \ndefinition \nof \nterm \n(viewed \nas \na \nlinguistic \nexplanation) \nfrom \nthe \ndefinition \nof \nconcept \n(considered as a logical specification). This implies \nthat a concept is neither a term nor a definition of a \nterm. \nThe \nstructure \nof \nontology-oriented \nterminology relies on the conceptual relationships \nfrom which linguistic relationships can be built. \nFurthermore, with such an approach new navigation \nmethods for browsing the knowledge base attached \nto the terminology become possible. Ontology can in \nfact be viewed as a conceptual map in which experts \nnavigate along the “is-a” and “part-of” relationships \nin order to access to information attached to \nconcepts. \nREFERENCES \nAlexeeva, L.M. 2006.
