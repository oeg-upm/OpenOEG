All the methodological guidelines are \ndescribed using a filling card and a workflow. \nThus, taking into account the aforementioned methodological work [4], the filling \ncard for the ontology requirements specification activity is provided in Fig. 1. Such \nfilling card explains the information of this activity in a practical and easy way.  \n \nFig. 1. Ontology Requirements Specification Filling Card. \nThe output of the ontology requirements specification activity is the ORSD. A \ntemplate (shown in Table 1) for the creation of the ORSD document is also provided \nin this section. This template contains information about the purpose, scope, \nimplementation language, intended end-users, intended uses, requirements, and pre-\nglossary of terms of the ontology which is being built. \n",
