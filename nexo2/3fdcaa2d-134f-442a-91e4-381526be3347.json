Scheduling Filling Card \nAs stated in Figure 15, the scheduling activity must be carried out after the ontology requirements \nspecification activity. It is worth to mention that it is advisory to carry out a quick search for \nknowledge-aware resources using as input the ontology requirement specification document \nbefore to carry out the scheduling activity.  \nThe tasks for carrying out the scheduling activity can be seen in Figure 16, and are explained in \ndetail below.  \n",
