Each classiﬁcation scheme item group (i.e. entity) is mapped to a\nclass. An ad-hoc binary relation is deﬁned between the new classes according to the\nsemantics of the relation between super-ordinate and sub-ordinate classiﬁcation scheme\nitems. Each classiﬁcation scheme item included on an entity is mapped to an instance of\nthe entity class. The semantics of the relationship between sub-ordinate and super-ordinate\ninstances are mapped to an ad-hoc binary relation instance.\nGraphical Representation\n(UML) General Solution\nOntology\n(UML) Example Solution\nOntology\nPROCESS: How to Re-engineer\n",
