Support activities include the following activities: knowledge acquisition, ontology evaluation, \nontology documentation, ontology summarization, ontology assessment, and ontology \nconfiguration management.  \n \nFigure 34. NeOn Activity Classification \nThe previous activity classification provides an implicit preliminary order for the activities, as Figure \n35 shows. Figure 35 illustrates the connections among the different activities. To sum up, the first \nactivity to be carried out is an environment and feasibility study to decide whether the ontology \nnetwork should be developed or not. If software developers and ontology practitioners decide that \nthe ontology network should be developed, then they should carry out the ontology scheduling \nactivity to obtain the concrete plan for the ontology network development. After this activity, \nactivities from the management, development-oriented, and support groups should be carried out \nfollowing the ontology network life cycle established in the ontology scheduling activity. Section 5.3 \nexplains in detail the different steps to be carried out within the ontology scheduling activity, which \nmainly includes the ontology network life cycle establishment and the setting of temporal and \nresource information.   \n",
