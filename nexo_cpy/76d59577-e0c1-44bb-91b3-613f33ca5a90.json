An increasing number of atomic ontology editing operations are associated\nwith lexico-syntactic patterns, according to the ontological information these patterns and the participating\nentities contribute. The ﬂexibility of this association enables us to approach the transformation of linguistic\nstructures into lightweight ontological knowledge in an incremental fashion. Also, the opportunity to incorpo-\nrate any kind of additional knowledge into the system allows us to experiment with different settings, and use\nSPRAT as a research platform rather than a black box product. This sets it apart from partial approaches\nsuch as Hearst, because it offers a platform to dynamically include new algorithms.\nIn summary, the SPRAT tool assists the user in the generation and/or population of ontologies from text,\nusing linguistic patterns. We have developed a number of new GATE plugins, including NEBOnE for editing\nthe ontology, and TermRaider for ﬁnding new terms. In general, the rules give good recall, but precision\nis a little low. The idea behind this work is to investigate the extent to which such patterns can be used\neither on their own or in conjunction with the user to generate or populate a more detailed ontology from\ntext. Currently, there is a good basis, but some work to go in improving the rules, and we have put forward a\nnumber of suggestions for ways in which this might be done.\n",
