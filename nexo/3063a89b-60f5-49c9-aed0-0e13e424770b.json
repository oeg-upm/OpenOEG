Are there open \nissues? Where to seek insights?\n•\n \nOntologies and their Fitnesses\n–\n \nWhat is an ontology? –\n \nconceptually and formally …\n–\n \nHow to make an ontology  a “shared specification”\n \nof domain \nknowledge?\n–\n \nOntology Fitness –\n \na key metric of being “shared”\n•\n \nThe Law of Gravitation – for Domains and \nOntologies\n–\n \nWhat if the forces between domains and ontologies\n \nexisted? \nHow would these look like –\n \nin a model?\n•\n \nSupporting Techniques and Tools\n–\n \nNow we have a model, so what? Is it adequate? Do we have \ninstruments to measure things and compute forces? \n•\n \nAn Outline of Potential Use Cases\n–\n \nEven so, how could these be used? Would these make our lives \nbetter? \n",
