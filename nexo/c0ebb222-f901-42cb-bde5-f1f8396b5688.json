In particular, we will present:\nthe concepts of ontology and annotation in the context of Semantic Web and corporate semantics,\nthe fundamental theory and best-known ontologies;\nlanguages RDF(S) and OWL,\nthe methodologies, methods and techniques used in its building that include guidelines for identifying the life-cycle, specification, planning, conceptualisation, correspondences, reuse, reengineering, etc.;\nmethods and techniques for the annotation of resources and significant applications.\nThroughout the entire module open research problems will be set that allow students to provide innovative solutions.\nLectures structure\n\nAll lectures, except for the introductory one, will follow this structure:\nPresentation (90 minutes)\nDiscussion about work done during the week (e.g., papers that have been read, assignment that has been carried out) (25 minutes)\nDescription of work to be done for the following week (5 minutes)\nEvaluation\n\nEvaluation will be done on the basis of: weekly work and participation in discussion (10%), ontology building assignment (30%), Linked Data assignment (30%) and research work (30%)\nPartial assignments that will be done throughout the academic year, and which are specified in the schedule section, will allow creating the aforementioned ontology building and Linked Data assignments, which will be presented orally on 16/12/2010. The optional research work will have to be submitted in January 2011 (31/01/2011).\nThe evaluation on July will be on\nJuly 7th\n, 15:00, in room 6206. Students must present the ontololgy building and Linked Data assignment, and optionally a research work.\nSend your hands-on to the following email\nmasterr10@delicias.dia.fi.upm.es\nSchedule and Material",
