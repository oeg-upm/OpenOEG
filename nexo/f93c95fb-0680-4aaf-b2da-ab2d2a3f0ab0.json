In this case, each\nhierarchy level is represented on a different column. There are as many columns as levels the classiﬁcation\nscheme has. The hierarchy is represented using one single entity where each hierarchy level is stored on a\ndifferent column. In this case, hierarchy levels must be known in advance. Figure 4.6 depicts this model.\nFigure 4.6: Flattened data model.\n4.2.2\nClassiﬁcation Scheme Implementations\nFinally these data models can be implemented as any of the identiﬁed types on section 2.1, i.e. databases,\nXML ﬁles, ﬂat ﬁles, and spreadsheets. A direct implementation would be as tables in a relational database\nor in a spreadsheet. Figure 4.2.2 presents an XML implementation of the adjacency list model of the water\narea classiﬁcation, and Figure 4.2.2 presents a spreadsheet implementation of the path enumeration model\nof the same classiﬁcation scheme.\nFigure 4.7: Water Area Classiﬁcation Scheme XML\nImplementation for the Adjacency List Data Model.\n",
