Also run a simulation in which Number_of starts at a value \nhigher than Zero. Does this situation lead to the population becoming extinct (thus \nNumber_of going to Zero)? Why not? An additional assignment could be to adapt the \nmodel such that it does go to Zero, e.g. by including an emigration process. \n \n",
