Villazón\n4\nOntological Engineering\nTypes of Ontology Design Patterns\nContent OPs (CPs) encode conceptual, rather than\nlogical design patterns.\nLogical OPs solve design problems independently of a \nparticular conceptualization.\nCPs propose patterns for solving design problems for\nthe domain classes and properties that populate an\nontology. They address content problems.\nArchitectural OPs affect the overall shape of the\nontology: their aim is to constrain ʻhow the ontology\nshould look likeʼ.\nA Logical OP is a formal expression, whose\nonly\nparts\nare expressions\nfrom\na logical\nvocabulary e.g., OWL DL, that solves a problem\nof expressivity.\nLogical OPs are independent from a specific\ndomain\nof\ninterest\ni.e. they\nare content-\nindependent\n",
