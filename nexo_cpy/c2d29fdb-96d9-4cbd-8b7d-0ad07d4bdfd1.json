This thesaurus\nis a concept-based thesaurus and it follows the record-based model.\nPattern for Re-engineering Non-Ontological Resources\nINPUT: Resource to be Re-engineered\nGeneral\nA non-ontological resource holds a concept-based thesaurus which follows the\nrecord-based model.\nA thesaurus represents the knowledge of a domain with a collection of terms and a limited\nset of relations between them.\nThe record-based data model [Soe95] is a denormalized structure, uses a record for every\nterm with the information about the term, such as synonyms, broader, narrower and related\nterms.\nExample\nThe Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV) is used in UK for indexing government\ndocuments.\nThe relation semantics between the sub-ordinate and the super-ordinate concepts is\nsubClassOf.\nGraphical Representation\nGeneral\nExample\nOUTPUT: Designed Ontology\nGeneral\nThe generated ontology will be based on the lightweight ontology architectural pattern\n(AP-LW-01)[SFBG+07]. Each thesaurus concept is mapped to a class. A subClassOf\nrelation is deﬁned between the new classes for the BC (Broader Concept)/NC (Narrower\nConcept) relation. A relatedClass relation is deﬁned between the new classes for the RT\nrelation. A label is created for every non-preferred term of a concept.\nGraphical Representation\n",
