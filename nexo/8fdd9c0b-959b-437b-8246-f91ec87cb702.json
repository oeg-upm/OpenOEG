They\naddress content problems.\n(E.g. Agent-Role)\nLogical ODPs are formal expressions, whose \nonly parts are expressions from a logical \nvocabulary e.g., OWL DL, that solve a problem \nof expressivity\n Logical ODPs are independent from a specific\ndomain\nof\ninterest, i.e. they\nare content-\nindependent\n Logical ODPs solve design problems where the\nprimitives of the representation language do not\ndirectly support certain logical constructs\n(E.g., N-Ary Relation)\n",
