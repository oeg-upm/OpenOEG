Examples are the following:\nLinked Data publishing tools:\nmorph-RDB (Freddy)\nmorph-GFT (Freddy)\nLODRefine\nOpen Refine (Esther Lozano: I have no experience with the tool, but I have a hands-on exercise from the course I could copy here) (Dani V. I could also help with this)\nHadoop (We (me, Dani V. and Freddy) tried to set up a Hadoop cluster in the lab, but couldn't, but I can describe the main features and how it should be installed and configured)\nELDA (Miguel Angel Garcia)\nPubby (Idafen)\nVirtuoso (Idafen)\nSILK (Dani G)\nMarimba (Dani V. Availability: from 10th of April)\n4store (Dani V. Availability: from 10th of April)\nOntology Documentation Tools\nLODE (Dani G)\nParrot (Dani G)\nOWLDoc (Dani G)\n(Linked) Stream Data management tools\nmorph-streams (Alejandro Llaves)\nStorm (Alejandro Llaves)\nAKKA (Alejandro Llaves)\nOntology evaluation tools\nOops! (Contributor for description: María. I could also describe other tools for ontology evaluation from others (XD-tools, etc))\nOntology development tools (would it fit?)\nNTK (Maria)\nProtege (Maria)\nTools for recommendation and selection\nRIDER, generic framework for recommendation that could be applied in LD domain (Filip)\nDBpedia related tools. See full list\nhere\n:\nLookup service\n. Provides keyword search and prefix search (aka autocomplete) (F. Siles)\nSpotlight\n. Useful for Named Entity Recognition, Name Resolution, and other information extraction tasks. (F. Siles)\netc.\nContributor for description: Almudena. I am no expert on any of the tools, but I could explore some tools and contribute to the catalog.\nScenarios for 3rd year review\n\nThese are the datasets that we have currently available:\nBus transport real-time data\n: There is a SPARQL-Stream pseudo-endpoint at\nhttp://streams.linkeddata.es/emt/sparqlstream\n(however, please note that we are not giving full support to the SPARQL protocol)\nAn example of a query:\nhttp://streams.linkeddata.es/emt/sparqlstream?query=SELECT\nDISTINCT\n?timeto ?obs FROM NAMED STREAM\n<\nhttp://emt.linkeddata.es/data#busstops.srdf\n> [NOW - 59 S] WHERE { ?obs a\n<\nhttp://emt.linkeddata.es/data#BusObservation\n>. ?obs\n<\nhttp://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn#observedBy\n><http://transporte.linkeddata\n.es/emt/busstop/id/2018>. ?obs\n<\nhttp://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn#observationResult\n> ?output. ?output\n<\nhttp://emt.linkeddata.es/data#timeToBusValue\n> ?av. ?av\n<\nhttp://data.nasa.gov/qudt/owl/qudt#numericValue\n> ?timeto. }\nThe static bus stops are at a SPARQL endpoint in:\nhttp://linkeddata4.dia.fi.upm.es:8080/sparql\n, inside graph:\nhttp://emt.transporte.linkeddata.es/graph/stops\nNote that we do not have currently all bus stops (just showing part of them, as it was enough for our demo).\nMetro, buses, tram stops in Madrid\n. Checking with the traffic authorities consortium how to publish this as linked data.\nCensus of business units in Madrid\n.\nDistrict and neighborhood data of Madrid\n(with their polygons in GeoSPARQL).\nDetails on passenger access to the metro\n(using a card similar to the Oyster card in London).\nCredit card transactions\nin several businesses in Madrid.\nODEMapster/Mappingpedia\n\nImplementation\nIntegration of MonetDB with ODEMapster (Oct 2010)\nImplementation of triple pattern to SQL (Nov 2010)\nImplementation of BGP+MappingDocument to SQL (April/May 2011)\nImplementation of FILTER/OPT/SELECT/ORDER BY/LIMIT to SQL (Summer2011)\nIntegration with NeOn Toolkit ODEMapster GUI? Both of ODEMapster2 and Morph\nhttp://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/wiki/index.php/R2O_y_ODEMapster#ODEMapster_2\nPerfomance Evaluation\n(synthetic dataset : BSBM 250K triples) row vs column based db (Summer2011)\n(scientific dataset : PSSA) evalution (Summer2011)\nMySQL :\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/531378/sparql2sql/mysql.pdf\nDetail :\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/531378/sparql2sql/r2rml-bsbm250k-mysql.xls\nDB2 :\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/531378/sparql2sql/DB2.png\nMSSQL :\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/531378/sparql2sql/MSSQL.png\nPaper\nPaper after evaluation. Where? Probably ESWC2012 or WWW2012 or DEXA2012\nWatch List\n\nNISB Project :\nhttp://www.nisb-project.eu/\nScrapper Wiki :\nhttp://scraperwiki.com/\nSchemapedia :\nhttp://schemapedia.com/\nWP 1 Data Streams and Dynamicity\n\nUPM has 11PM, EPFL has 5PM and JSI has 8PM\nTask 1.1 Modelling, integration and adaptation to unknown and changing data sources\n\nRearrange the content of Deliverable D1.1 to be circulated in WP1 member (Dec 2010, Freddy)\nExplain better the differences between C-SPARQL and SPARQL-STR (Dec 2010, JP)\nhttp://code.google.com/p/semanticstreams/wiki/SPARQLStreamOtherApproaches\nYear 1: Provide GSN and Pachube data sources as case studies for the SSG4Env API (D5.2v2)\nOne option: S2O Mappings between SSN/PlanetData Vocabulary with Sensor Platform(GSN, Pachube,etc) (Freddy)\nAnother option :\nPachube2RDF\nPachube2RDF (Freddy, 31Aug2011): find out how to get features of interest and properties from Pachube tables.\nYear 1: write deliverable D1.1!!!<del>\nhttp://wiki.planet-data.eu/web/D1.1\nSPARQL-STR & MonetDB (Jean Paul, wait for Jennie's information). Do query rewriting for MonetDB Continuous query language\nSSN Ontology (Oscar, september 2011). Get a list of people/systems using the SSN Ontology.\nKIT, Royal Netherlands Met Institute, AEMET\nYear 2: think about combining modalities (e.g., something like opensense.epfl.ch).\nSensor data characterisation\nUPM and EPFL will work towards using the statistical analysis of sensor data to help on the disambiguation of Pachube/GSN observed  roperties\nUPM will continue bringing in sensor data from organisations like AEMET, SOS services, etc.\nUPM and JSI should pursue together the development of demos for multi-modal integration (weather sensor data + news talking about weather + tweets about weather when something relevant happens, etc.).\nJean Paul will continue with the idea of making his implementation as scalable as possible.\nYear 3: think about how to provide brochures on how to use our techniques for Big Data processing of streams\nSources: Jabatus (\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/JubatusOfficial/distributed-online-machine-learning-framework-for-big-data\n)\nWP 2 Quality Assessment and Context\n\nUPM has 3PM\nTask 2.2 – Temporal, spatial and social aspects of data\n\n<del> Tools for transformation geography objects (GML, Oracle Spatial, etc) to RDF (Jan 2011, Luis and Víctor)\nhttp://mayor2.dia.fi.upm.es/oeg-upm/index.php/en/downloads/151-geometry2rdf\nProvision and maintenance of geo vocabulary\nNeoGeo Vocabulary (Luis)\npush forward the work on the NeoGeo vocabulary\nadapt it also to the Spanish speaking community\nmove towards a vocabulary that we may send to a W3C community group\ndemos\nContinued support for Geometry2RDF\nBoris: Upload Geometry2RDF to Google Code\nWP 4 Data Provisioning and WP5 PlanetData Lab\n\nUPM has 3PM in WP4, however we can dedicate more time if needed, since it is the main focus of Freddy's PhD thesis. Anyway, this effort will be moved to WP5, Task 5.1 PlanetData infrastructure.\nT4.4 Assembly and maintenance of a catalogue of data provisioning tools (Leader: UPM)",
