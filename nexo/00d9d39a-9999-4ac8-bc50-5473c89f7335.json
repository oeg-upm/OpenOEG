Consider an ER+ schema C , and let R be the relational schema\nassociated to it. The set of TGDs and KDs over R obtained from C as described\nabove is called the set of conceptual dependencies (CDs) associated to C .\nExample 1.4. Consider the ER+ schema C given in Example 1.2. The relational\nschema R associated to C is given in Example 1.3. The set Σ of CDs over R\nassociated to C is the following:\nmember(X) →∃Yworks in(X,Y) leads(X,Y) →professor(X)\nkey(works in) = {1}\nleads(X,Y) →group(Y)\nphd student(X) →member(X)\nleads(X,Y) →works in(X,Y)\nprofessor(X) →member(X)\nmemb name(X,Y) →member(X)\nkey(leads) = {1}\nmember(X) →∃Ymemb name(X,Y)\ngroup(X) →∃Yworks in(Y,X)\nkey(memb name) = {1},\ngroup(X) →∃Yleads(Y,X)\nstud gpa(X,Y) →phd student(X)\nkey(leads) = {2}\ngr name(X,Y) →group(X)\nworks in(X,Y) →member(X),\nsince(X,Y,Z) →works in(X,Y)\nworks in(X,Y) →group(Y)\nIn general, a set of CDs associated to an ER+ schema consists of key and inclusion\ndependencies, where the latter are a special case of TGDs [32].\nNotice that it is possible to characterize the form of relational dependencies re-\nsulting from the translation of ER+ schemata into relational schemata. This char-\nacterization appears in [30]. Relational dependencies (key and inclusion dependen-\ncies) which are derived from ER+ schemata are said to be in conceptual dependency\nform (abbreviated as CD-form). It is also possible to show that a set of key and inclu-\nsion dependencies is associated to some ER+ schema if and only if it is in CD-form.\n1.3.3 Relevant sublanguages\nTwo subclasses of ER+ schemata that are of special interest are schemata where\nonly the identity permutation can be used in is-a constraints between relationships,\nand where only relationships of bounded arity are allowed.\nDeﬁnition 1.2. Consider a set Σ of CDs over a schema R. Σ is a set of identity\npermutation CDs (IPCDs) if for each TGD of Σ of the form r1(X1,...,Xn) →\nr2(Xi1,...,Xin), where {r1,r2} encode relationships in the associated ER+ schema,\nit holds that [i1,...,in] = idn, where idn is the identity permutation [1,...,n] of the\nset [n]. Σ is a set of bounded arity CDs (BACDs) if all the predicates encoding rela-\ntionships in the associated ER+ schema are of bounded arity.\nBeing able to encode ER+ schemata into relational ones with dependencies, in\nour study we will exploit techniques used in the case of relational schemata with\n",
