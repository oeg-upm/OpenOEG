Once the mappings are established between the ele-\nments, the structure comparison process detects that some model structures are missing\nin the user model. Figure 6 exempliﬁes this. In the example, an inequality property in\nNumber of quantity and the positive inﬂuence between the quantities Birth and Number\nof are pointed out to allow the user to make the corresponding changes.\nPopulation\nPopulation\nPopulation\nNumber of\nSml\nLarge\nMedium\nSmall\nZero\nBirth\nZp\nPlus\nZero\n(a) Reference model fragment.\nPopulation\nPopulation\nPopulation\nNumber of\nSml\nLarge\nMedium\nSmall\nZero\nBirth\nZp\nPlus\nZero\n(b) User model fragment with missing struc-\ntures.\nFig. 6.

We measure\nthe coverage as the amount of terms that a resource is able to describe semantically,\ndivided by the total examined terms.\n",
