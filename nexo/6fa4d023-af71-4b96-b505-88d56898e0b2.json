These feature \nspecifications consist of a feature and a value, e.g. \"TARGET GROUP: popu-\nlation\". The boxes across the concept relations represent subdivision criteria. \nWe use this representation of characteristics because it clarifies the relation \nbetween characteristics and subdivision criteria: For any given concept the \nfeature of a non-inherited characteristic may be a subdivision criterion for the \nsuperordinate concept. The clarification makes it much easier to identify sub-\ndivision criteria and differentiating characteristics in practical terminology \nwork. \nfeature specification\nsubdividision criteria\npolyhierarchy\ninheritance\nfeature specification\nsubdividision criteria\npolyhierarchy\ninheritance\n \n \nFigure 1: Extract of an ontology for types of prevention3\n \n Figure 1 shows an example of inheritance of characteristics. The concept \nhealth campaign is a subordinate concept to universal prevention, and thus \nit inherits the feature specification \"TARGET GROUP: population\". Figure \n1 also shows an example of polyhierarchy. The concept universal primary \nprevention has as superordinate concepts both the concept universal preven-\ntion and primary prevention. This also gives an example of inheritance, \nsince the concept universal primary prevention inherits the feature specifi-\n3.
