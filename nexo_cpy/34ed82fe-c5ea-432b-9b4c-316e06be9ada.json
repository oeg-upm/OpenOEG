To create a NeOn wiki page dedicated to the consensus reaching process, within the NeOn \nconsortium. \n2. To create a template for gathering general information about activities (definition, \nclassification, inputs, outputs, etc.) and to publish this template in the wiki. \n3. To create an initial list of activities with definitions. \n4. To identify and define the activities collaboratively in the wiki according to the initial list.  \n5. To reach a consensus on the activity definitions. \n6. To publish the final results in the NeOn website6 and in a public wiki page and to establish \nthe procedure for getting feedback from the Ontology Engineergin (OE) community, using \nthe argumentation tool “Cicero” (which is already a wiki). \n7. To propose the standardization of the NeOn Glossary of Activities.  \n                                                 \n6 http://www.neon-project.org/ \n \n",
