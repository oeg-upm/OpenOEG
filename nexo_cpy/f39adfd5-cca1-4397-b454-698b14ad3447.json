Finally, a pattern for re-engineering non-ontological resources\nhas to be searched according to the type of non-ontological resource, the internal data model\nand the semantics of the relations between the non-ontological resource entities.\n• Task 5.a. Use patterns for re-engineering to guide the transformation. The goal of this task\nis to apply the re-engineering pattern obtained in task 4 to transform the non-ontological resource\ninto a conceptual model. If a suitable pattern for re-engineering non-ontological resource is found\nthen the conceptual model is created from the non-ontological resource following the procedure\nestablished in the pattern for re-engineering.\n• Task 5.b. Perform and ad-hoc transformation. The goal of this task is to set up an ad-hoc\nprocedure to transform the non-ontological resource into a conceptual model, when a suitable\npattern for re-engineering was not found. This ad-hoc procedure may be generalized to create a\nnew pattern for re-engineering non-ontological resource.\n3. Ontology Forward Engineering, whose goal is to generate the ontology. We use the ontology levels\nof abstraction to depict this activity because they are directly related to the ontology development\nprocess.\n• Task 6. Formalize. The goal of this task is to transform the conceptual model obtained in task 5.a\nor 5.b into a formalized model, according to a knowledge representation paradigm as description\nlogics, ﬁrst order logic, etc.\n• Task 7. Implement. The goal of this task is the ontology implementation in an ontology language.\n",
