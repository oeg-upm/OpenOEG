The metrics explained in Section 4.2 (MAP, P@N, R@N, F,\nMRR and NDCG) were computed for each approach with English and Span-\nish entities. We also report the metric values for only (English/Spanish) named\nand unnamed entities. It is important to note that recall is computed assuming\nthat the set of all tags relevant to a given tag is composed by the relevant (see\ndeﬁnition above) entities retrieved by the investigated approaches. We cannot\nassure that we are able to retrieve all relevant entities but a strong representative\nsample of them.\nWilcoxon’s statistical tests were performed to determine whether there were\nstatistical signiﬁcance diﬀerences between the metric values obtained with the\nbaseline and the proposed approaches, and between the metric values obtained\nwith Sem4Tags approach and its variants Sem4TagsAC, Sem4TagsAbs, and\nSem4TagsAbsAC. The statistical tests were applied on those tagging activities\nwhere all approaches (including the baseline) were able to link at least one DBpe-\ndia resource. This allows us to present a more fair comparison among approaches,\nbut implies a loss of information that hides a higher statistical evidence in the\ndiﬀerences with metric values of approaches able to link DBpedia resources in a\nlarge number of cases.\n",
