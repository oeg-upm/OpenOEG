Now, a \nnew phase (the Merging Phase) is added after the reuse one. This merging phase has as a \nmain purpose to obtain a new ontological resource from two or more ontological resources \nselected in the reuse phase.  \nFor the other phases the purposes and outcomes are the same as those presented in the five-\nphase model. \n \nFigure 10. Five-Phase + Merging Phase Waterfall Ontology Network Life Cycle Model \n\u0001 Six-phase waterfall ontology network life cycle model. \nIn this model, shown in Figure 11, the five-phase model is taken as general basis and a new \nphase (Reengineering Phase) is included after the reuse one. This model allows the reuse of \nknowledge aware resources (ontological and non-ontological) and their later reengineering. In \nthis model the reuse phase has as output one or more knowledge resources to be reused in \nthe ontology network that is being developed. After this phase, the non-ontological resources \n",
