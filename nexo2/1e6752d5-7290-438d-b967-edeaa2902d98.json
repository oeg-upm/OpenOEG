Three new profiles \n• \nOWL2 EL \n- \nOntologies that define very large numbers of classes and/or properties  \n- \nOntology consistency, class expression subsumption, and instance checking can be \ndecided in polynomial time  \n• \nOWL2 QL \n- \nSound and complete query answering is in LOGSPACE (more precisely, in AC0) with \nrespect to the size of the data (assertions) \n- \nProvides many of the main features necessary to express conceptual models (UML \nclass diagrams and ER diagrams)  \n- \nIt contains the intersection of RDFS and OWL 2 DL \n• \nOWL2 RL \n- \nInspired by Description Logic Programs and pD* \n- \nSyntactic subset of OWL 2 which is amenable to implementation using rule-based \ntechnologies \n- \nScalable reasoning without sacrificing too much expressive power \n- \nDesigned for \n• \nOWL applications trading the full expressivity of the language for efficiency,  \n• \nRDF(S) applications that need some added expressivity from OWL 2.  \n51 \n",
