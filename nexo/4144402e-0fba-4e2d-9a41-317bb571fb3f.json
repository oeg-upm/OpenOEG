(2010) should be used to produce an equivalent \nlogical plan.\n \nBasic rewriting rules must be applied for a first step\n●\nsee what simple rules already enforced by ARQ framework\n●\nprogressively add features\n●\nFilter Basic Graph Patterns (FBGP) first targeted\n○\nClearly identify set of rules. Compare to Perez et al. (2009).\nPhysical Optimization\nLogical plan transformed to physical one and physical operators are introduced at this point.\n●\ninclude semi-join/bind-join implementation where necessary\n \nThe optimization of the physical plan is focused basically on the join optimization using the \ncollected statistics.\nStatistics\n●\nServices description updated, using void, scovo\n○\ndetermine the exact information needed?\n○\ncardinality based unfeasible, streaming data requires other mechanisms\n○\nin the end most likely selectivity estimations, search for methods to calculate\n○\nStreams rates if available\nCapturing the metadata\n●\nstill to propose a technique\n●\nfor first attempts assume to have it provided?\n●\nmust have dynamic means to keep it updated, in stream environment can be highly \ndynamic\nCost model\n●\nNeed to read in detail, proposals in stream world\nDistributed Processing\n●\nTriple pattern based capabilities per source. May be the way, as in DARQ (Quilitz and \nLeser, 2008). Metadata is provided by each source.\n●\nProduce a set of sub-parts of the optimized plan, each to be delivered to a respective \nsource. It must be sent as a serialized query statement.\n",
