A class \nmay have multiple superclasses and subclasses. \nSubclass-of is transitive: if (subclass-of C1 C2) and \n(subclass-of C2 C3) then (subclass-of C1 C3). \nObject-centered systems sometimes distinguish \nbetween a subclass-of relationship that is asserted \nand one that is inferred. For example, (subclass-of \nC1 C3) might be inferred from asserting (subclass-of \nC1 C2) and (subclass-of C2 C3)...\"\n:iff-def\n(and (Class ?parent-class) \n(Class ?child-class) \n(forall (?instance) \n(=> (Instance-Of ?instance ?child-class) \n(Instance-Of ?instance ?parent-class)))) \n:axiom-constraints\n(Transitive-Relation Subclass-Of)\n:issues\n((:see-also direct-subclass-of) \n(:see-also \"In CycL, subclass-of is called #%allGenls\nbecause it is a slot from a collection to all of its   \ngeneralizations  (superclasses).\"\n\"In the KL-ONE literature, subclass \nrelationships are also called subsumption relationships \nand ISA is sometimes used for subclass-of.\") \n(\"Why is it called Subclass-of instead of subclass or \nsuperclass?\"\n\"Because the latter are ambiguous about the order of \ntheir arguments. We are following the naming \nconvention that a binary relationship is read as an \nEnglish sentence `Domain-element Relation-name \nRange-value'. Thus, `person subclass-of animal' rather \nthan `person superclass animal'.\")))\nhttp://www-ksl.stanford.edu\n",
