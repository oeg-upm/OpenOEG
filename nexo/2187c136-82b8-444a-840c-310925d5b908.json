A \nClock is always associated with a particular single TimeLine (there could be TimeLines \nwith no Clock but also TimeLines having several different Clocks associated with  \nthem). Different Clocks, associated with the same TimeLine or different TimeLines \nmay “run” differently, e.g. quicker or slower and also with offsets compared to each \nother. Some Clocks may be related to each other for enabling a proper comparison of \nthe values they return. This is done by specifying a ClockRelation. A specific and most \nwidely used kind of a ClockRelation is AffineClockRelation which allows aligning \ndifferent time velocities (using the scaleFactor property) and also time offsets, like delays \n(using the shift property). A Clock, as a measurement instrument, may return a single \nvalue (a TimeStamp corresponding to a single TimeUnit) or several values (the parts of \na TimeStamp corresponding to different TimeUnits). A PhysicalClock and a \nLogicalClock are the two disjoint specializations of a Clock.\n+ OWL\nongoing work by \nEugene Alferov\n \nas \npart of his PhD project\n",
