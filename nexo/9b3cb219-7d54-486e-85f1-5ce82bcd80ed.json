We therefore cannot assume\nthat an individual is not a member of a particular class simply because\nit has not been asserted to be a member of that class.\n•\nIn order to ‘separate’ a group of classes we must make them disjoint\nfrom one another. This ensures that an individual which has been\nasserted to be a member of one of the classes in the group cannot be a\nmember of any other classes in that group.\n",
