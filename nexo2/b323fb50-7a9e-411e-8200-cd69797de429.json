UNDERSTANDABILITY EFFORT (I)\n\u0001 \nUnderstandability Effort. It refers to the estimate of the effort needed for understanding the \ncandidate ontology. In this case, the following criteria should be analyzed: \n• \nQuality of the documentation. It refers to whether there is any communicable material to \ndescribe or explain different aspects of the candidate ontology (e.g., modelling decisions). The \ndocumentation should explain the knowledge pieces represented in the ontology, so that a non-\nexpert could understand the knowledge represented in it.  \n• \nAvailability of external knowledge sources. It refers to whether the candidate ontology has \nreferences to documentation sources, and whether experts are easily available. \n• \nCode clarity. It refers to whether the code is ease to understand and modify, that is, if the \nknowledge entities follow unified patterns and if patterns are clear. It is convenient to use the \nsame pattern to make sibling definitions, thus increasing ontology understanding and making it \neasier the inclusion of  new definitions. All of which would improve the clarity of the ontology \nand its monotonic extendibility. Code clarity also refers to whether the code is documented, that \nis, if it includes clear and coherent definitions and comments for the knowledge entities \nrepresented in the candidate ontology. \n",
