How many minutes have you devoted to the activity 1 identify the type of general ontology to \nbe reused? \n \n38. How many minutes have you devoted to the activity 3 search for general ontologies \n \n39. How many minutes have you devoted to the activity 4 carry out a comparative study? \n \n40. How many minutes have you devoted to the task 5.1 analyze the host CQs? \n \n41. How many minutes have you devoted to the task 5.2 identify the features of the general \nontologies? \n \n42. How many minutes have you devoted to the task 5.3 determine the general ontology that best \nfits? \n \n43. How many minutes have you devoted to the task 6.1 prune the general ontology? \n \n44. How many minutes have you devoted to the task 6.2 enrich the general ontology? \n \n45. How many minutes have you devoted to the task 6.3 translate the general ontology? \n \n46. How many minutes have you devoted to the task 6.4 evaluate the obtained general ontology? \n \n47. How many minutes have you devoted to the activity 7 integrate the general ontology? \n \n48. How many minutes have you devoted to test the host ontology? \n \n \nCOMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS: \n \nWe are especially interested in the comments and suggestions for those features to \nwhich you have assigned lower values (1, 2 or 3). \n",
