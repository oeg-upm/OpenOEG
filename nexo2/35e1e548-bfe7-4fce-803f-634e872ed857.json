If we want to know if two objects have common parts, then we should reformulate the CQ to \ninclude the term overlap. \nHeuristic 6 (underlap). If we want to know if two objects have common wholes, then we should reformulate the CQ \nto include the term underlap. \nHeuristic 7 (proper part). If we want to know the parts of an object not including the object itself, then we should \nreformulate the CQ to include the term proper part of. \nHeuristic 8 (direct part). If we want to know the first level of decomposition of an object, then we should \nreformulate the CQ to include the term is direct part of \nHeuristic 9 (part of). If we want to know the parts of an object, including the object itself, then we should \nreformulate the CQ to include the term is part of. A typical case is that in which the mereological relation appears in \na composition of relations.  \nHeuristic 10 (disjoint). If we want to know which parts of object o1 are not in object o2, then we should reformulate \nthe CQ to include the term are disjoint. \nHeuristic 11 (subrelations of part_of). If we applied Heuristic 2, then we should introduce a linking axiom \nestablishing that S is a subrelation of part_of. \n",
