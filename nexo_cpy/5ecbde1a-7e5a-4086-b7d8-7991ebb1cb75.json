Scenario 8: Building Ontology Networks by Localizing Ontologies or Ontology \nModules  \n Assumptions: It is supposed that software developers and ontology practitioners “want” to \ninclude multilinguality in an ontology or an ontology module. \n Prerequisite resources: Knowledge about the domain (general or specific) of the ontology \nnetwork to be developed should be available for building the ontology network. Knowledge \nresources in different idioms (e.g., thesauri, dictionaries, etc.) should also be available. \n Sequence of activities: Once the ontology has been conceptualized and restructured, it can \nrequire the translation of all its terms into another natural language (Spanish, French, German, \netc.) different from the language used in the conceptualization, using multilingual thesauri and \nelectronic dictionaries (e.g. EuroWordNet). This possibility is shown in scenario 8 in Figure 20 \nand, in this case, ontology developers carry out the ontology localization activity. \nAfter this localization activity, the resulting conceptual model should be integrated in the \nconceptualization activity in scenario 1 (Section 4.1). \n Outcomes: The principal outcome is a conceptual model of the ontology network in different \nnatural languages (that is, a multilingual conceptual model) that represents the expected \ndomain.  \n2006–2007 © Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions. \n \n",
