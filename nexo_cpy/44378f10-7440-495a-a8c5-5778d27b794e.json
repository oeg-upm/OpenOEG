  "message": "SYSTEM: StepByStepSample.pdf: Página 1\nStep by step Example: \n-- I assume the basic concepts about RDF-a have been introduced previously-- \n \n1 \nLearn how to annotate the page  \nExercises: \n○ Annotate the Title of my page (dcterms: title) \n○ Annotate the date of my page (dcterms:created) \n○ Have I used a template? specify that it was prov:wasDerivedFrom that template \n(yes, I have to include the standard :) ) (prov:wasDerivedFrom) \n \nExample (modified from RDFa Primer):  \n<html> \n<head> \n  ... \n</head> \n<body resource =”http://ourpage” >  ←----This indicates that we are annotating our page \n  ... \n  <h2 property=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title\">My personal Page</h2> \n  <p>Date: <span property=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/created\">2011-09-10</span></p> \n…   \n<p> \nThe web site template used in this page is attributed to \n<a property=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom” title=\"Website Templates\" \nhref=\"http://www.bluewebtemplates.com/”>website templates</a> \n</p> \n... \n</body> \n \nThe one with “href” is important, as we can see that the value of the property is mapped to the \nvalue of the anchor of the RDF. If we have an image, something similar will occur with the “src” \nvalue. \n \n2 \nLearn how to annotate different resources in my page (distinguishing ME from the PAGE, \nfrom an IMAGE of my page). This is particularly interesting when I want to annotate \nblogs and posts. \nNote: In order to avoid discussion, here are the URIs we are going to use: \n○ ME: http://mywebpage/#me \n○ OEG: http://oeg-upm.net/#this \nExercises:  \n○ Annotate #me as a person (http://schema.org/Person, foaf:Person) \n○ Annotate my Name (foaf:name, schema:name) \n○ Annotate my Last Name (foaf:familyName, schema:familyName) \n○ Annotate my Institution (foaf:Organization, foaf:member, schema:memberOf, \nschema:Organization) \n",
