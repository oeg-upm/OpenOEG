The semantics of the hierarchical relation between\nparents and children concepts may vary depending of the context.\nThe snowﬂake data model [MZ06] is a normalized structure for hierarchy representations. In\nthis case, the classiﬁcation scheme items are grouped by levels or entities. There are as\nmany groups as levels the classiﬁcation scheme has.\nExample\nSnowﬂakes models are widely used on data warehouses to build hierarchical classiﬁcations\non structures known as dimensions. Some examples of dimension are Time, Product\nCategory, Geography, Occupations, etc.\nIn this pattern the example is a occupation hierarchical classiﬁcation hold on four different\ntables, one for each level (PROFESSIONI_0, PROFESSIONI_1, PROFESSIONI_2,\nPROFESSIONI_3).\nGraphical Representation\nGeneral\nExample\nOUTPUT: Designed Ontology\nGeneral\nThe generated ontology will be based on the taxonomy architectural pattern (AP-TX-01)\n[SFBG+07]. Each category in the classiﬁcation scheme is mapped to a class, and the\nsemantics of the relationship between children and parent categories are mapped to\nsubClassOf relations.\nGraphical Representation\n",
