The use of this \nmodel reduces development and maintenance costs due to all of the above reasons. \n \nFigure 2. Pure Waterfall Life Cycle Model \nThe pure waterfall life cycle model [39, 46] is divided into sequential phases (analysis, design, \nimplementation and testing) and represents the stages as a waterfall, from a particular stage \nthrough the following one. This model represents the stages of a project, starting with the \nrequirements plan, such as the problem which the user has or thinks he has, through the analysis \nand definition of requirements, design, coding, testing, and operation to maintenance. The result of \neach phase is one or more documents that are approved (‘signed-off’) [52]. The following phase \nshould not start until the previous one has finished. For example, when all the requirements have \nbeen identified, analyzed to check their integrity and consistency, and documented, then the \ndevelopment team can begin with the activities related to the system design. \nIn practice, the waterfall life cycle model has a lineal order in the transitions between phases, with \na review for each phase. It is not possible to pass to the following phase until the current one has \nbeen not completed. This model permits to backtrack to previous phases if errors or mistakes are \ndetected [52]. Figure 3 shows this usual waterfall life cycle model. \n",
