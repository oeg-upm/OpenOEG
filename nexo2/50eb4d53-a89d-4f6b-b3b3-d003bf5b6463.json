It is based on the \nidea of having data on the Web defined and linked such that it \ncan be used for more effective discovery, automation, \nintegration, and reuse across various applications.”\nHendler, J., Berners-Lee, T., and Miller, E. \nIntegrating Applications on the Semantic Web, 2002, \nhttp://www.w3.org/2002/07/swint.html\n",
