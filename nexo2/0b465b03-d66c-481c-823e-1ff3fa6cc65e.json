Corcho, MC Suárez de Figueroa Baonza \n76 \nOWL 2 \nAutomatic Classification and Open World Assumption (I) \nWe want to use the reasoner to automatically compute the \nsuperclass-subclass relationship (subsumption relationship) \nbetween MargheritaPizza and VegetarianPizza.  \nWe believe that MargheritaPizza should be vegetarian pizza (they \nshould be subclasses of VegetarianPizza). This is because they have \ntoppings that are essentially vegetarian toppings — by our \ndefinition, vegetarian toppings are members of the classes \nCheeseTopping or VegetableTopping and their subclasses.  \nHaving previously created a definition for VegetarianPizza (using a \nset of necessary and sufficient conditions) we can use the reasoner \nto perform automatic classification and determine the vegetarian \npizzas in our ontology. \n",
