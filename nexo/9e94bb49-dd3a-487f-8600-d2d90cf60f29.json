The semantics of the hierarchical relation between\nparents and children concepts may vary depending of the context.\nThe path enumeration data model [Bra05] for classiﬁcation schemes take advantage of that\nthere is one and only one path from the root to every item in the classiﬁcation. The path\nenumeration model stores that path as string by concatenating either the edges or the keys\nof the classiﬁcation scheme items in the path.\nExample\nThe International Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupations (for European Union purposes),\n1988 version: ISCO-88 (COM) published by Eurostat6 is modeled with the path\nenumeration data model.\nGraphical Representation\nGeneral\nExample\nOUTPUT: Designed Ontology\nGeneral\nThe generated ontology will be based on the taxonomy architectural pattern (AP-TX-01)\n[SFBG+07]. Each category in the classiﬁcation scheme is mapped to a class, and the\nsemantics of the relationship between children and parent categories are mapped to\nsubClassOf relations.\nGraphical Representation\n(UML) General Solution\nOntology\n2006–2008 c⃝Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions.\n",
