The Project Support Processes \nsupport specialized management objectives. \n4. Technical Processes, which include eleven processes, are used to define the requirements \nfor a system, to transform the requirements into an effective product, to permit consistent \nreproduction of the product where necessary, to use the product, to provide the required \nservices, to sustain the provision of those services and to dispose of the product when it is \nretired from service. \n5. Software Implementation Processes, which include seven processes, are used to produce a \nspecified system element (software item) implemented in software. Those processes transform \nspecified behaviour, interfaces and implementation constraints into implementation actions \nresulting in a system element that satisfies the requirements derived from the system \nrequirements.  \n6. Software Support Processes, which includes eight processes, provide a specific focused set \nof activities for performing a specialized software process. A supporting process assists the \nSoftware Implementation Process as an integral part with a distinct purpose, contributing to the \nsuccess and quality of the software project. \n7. Software Reuse Processes, which includes three processes (domain engineering process, \nreuse program management process, and reuse asset management process), support an \norganization’s ability to reuse software items across project boundaries. \n",
