Ontology management activities include activities that initiate, monitor, and control an \nontology project throughout its life cycle. These activities are: \n The scheduling activity identifies the tasks to be performed, their arrangement, and the time \nand resources needed for their completion. This activity is essential for ontologies that use \nontologies stored in ontology libraries or for ontologies that require a high level of \nabstraction and generality.  \n The control activity guarantees that scheduled tasks are completed in the manner intended \nto be performed.  \n The quality assurance activity assures that the quality of each and every product output \n(ontology, software and documentation) is satisfactory.  \n2. Ontology development oriented activities are grouped, as presented in Figure 9, into pre-\ndevelopment, development and post-development activities. \nThe pre-development activities include activities that explore and allocate requirements \nbefore ontology development can begin. These activities are:  \n An environment study is carried out to know the platforms where the ontology will be \nused, the applications where the ontology will be integrated, etc.  \n A feasibility study answers questions such as: yous it possible to build the ontology? \nIs it suitable to build the ontology?, etc. \nThe development activities include activities performed during the development and \nenhancement of an ontology project. Such activities are:  \n The specification activity states why the ontology is being built, what its intended \nuses are and who the end-users are.  \n The conceptualization activity structures the domain knowledge as meaningful \nmodels at the knowledge level [45].  \n",
