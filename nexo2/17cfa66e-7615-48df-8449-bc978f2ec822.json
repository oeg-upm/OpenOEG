Espinoza \n50 \nOntological Engineering \nPatterns \nPattern is something proposed for imitation.  \nDesign Pattern refers to shared guidelines that help solve design problems.  \nOntology Design Pattern (ODP) is a modeling solution to solve a recurrent ontology \ndesign problem. \nOur concept of “pattern” is associable with the wider “good/best practice” of software \nengineering. It includes a wider range of solution types. For example: naming conventions \nin software engineering are considered good practices, they are not design patterns. \n",
