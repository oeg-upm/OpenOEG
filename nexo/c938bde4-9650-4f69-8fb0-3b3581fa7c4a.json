(Any questions will be answered at \nmegana@fi.upm.es). The deadline is 11/10/2011.\nIn questions 1 and 2 you have to create an OWL ontology. In questions 3 and 4, you just have to \nthink a bit and answer; you won't be marked on the correcteness of the answers, so don't be afraid to \nbe wrong in the case of 3 and 4. The aim of questions 3 and 4 is to make you think about OWL \nsemantics.\n1.- Create an OWL ontology using Protégé 4.1 that represents the following knowledge domain:\n•\nAll the Audi cars, Skoda cars and Volkswagen cars are cars.\n•\nAudi cars are not Skod cars nor Volkswagen cars.\n•\nIf we find a car made by Audi, it is an Audi car. \n•\nMikel's car is an Audi car.\n•\nAll the Audi cars have an engine that has exactly 4 cylinders and such engine is \nmade by at least an engine manufacturer.\n•\nAll the Audi cars have components made only by Audi, Skoda or Volkswagen, and \nall the Audi cars have at least one such component.\n2.- In the following ontology, the circles represent classes and the arrows represent subClassOf \naxioms: there is a root class with three subclasses, and each of those subclasses has more \nsubclasses. The continous lines represent asserted subClassOf axioms, whereas the dotted lines \nrepresent inferred subClassOf axioms. Thus, you have to create an OWL ontology holding the \nstructure of continous lines, and add axioms to classes in order to obtain the remaining subclass \naxioms structure if reasoning is performed (ie, more subclassof axioms cannot be asserted). You can \ngive the classes any name you like and create any properties needed.\n",
