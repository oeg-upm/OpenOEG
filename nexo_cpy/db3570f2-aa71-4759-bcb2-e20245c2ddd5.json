  "message": "SYSTEM: PROLEGintro_eng_long.pdf: Página 2\nMy Background\n• I have been working on logical foundations of AI under incomplete\ninformation called “non-monotonic reasoning”.\n• To seek the application of my work, I entered the law school in\nUniversity of Tokyo and learned law in 2006-2009.\n• During learning at the law school, I found that the theory of judge-\nment in civil litigation called “the ultimate fact theory” taught in\nthe law school is closely related with my work.\n• I developed a programming language called PROLEG (PROlog\nbased LEGal reasoning support system) based on the above idea\naimed at assisting law students and lawyers.\n• As a by-product of the research, I passed the bar exam in Japan\nin 2017.\n• I also started workshops on “juris-informatics”(JURISIN) from\n2007.\n2\n",
