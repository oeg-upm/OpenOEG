(1997) (Figure 4). Terminological ontology (in Figure 4) \nis probably equivalent to ontology with informal is-a hierarchy (in Figure 7), \nand knowledge modeling ontology (in Figure 4) could be equivalent to either \nglossary or ontology with logical constraints (in Figure 7). The exact equiva-\nlences are difficult to clarify from the sources. \nBased on the 4 papers mentioned above, Gómez-Pérez et al. (2003:28-34) \narrives at the typology presented in Figure 8. The left-hand side of this ontol-\nogy, subdivided according to structure, is identical to Lassila & McGuiness \n(2001), and therefore we have not repeated the concepts in Figure 8. Gómez-\nPérez et al. (2003) do not discuss to what extent the concepts in this range \ncorrespond to the three concepts given by van Heijst et al. (1997). They men-\ntion the concepts lightweight and heavyweight ontology, as the two ends of \nthe range introduced by the subdivision criterion RICHNESS OF THE \nSTRUCTURE in Figure 8. We have not included these, since it is not clear \nexactly which ontologies in Figure 7 are light- or heavyweight respectively. \nFigure 8: Ontologies according to Gómez-Pérez et al.

Note that here the authors include two concepts not introduced \nearlier: domain-task ontology and method ontology. These concepts are diffi-\ncult to distinguish from domain ontology and task ontology, and it may be the \n \n8\n \n",
