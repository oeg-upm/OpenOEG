For each hierarchy level a \nentity is created. In this model each hierarchy node has \na column linked to its parent node.\n•\nFlattened Data Model, is a denormalized structure.  \nThe hierarchy is represented with an entity where \neach hierarchy level is stored on a different column. \n1\n2\n3\n",
