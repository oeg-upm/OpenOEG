British English has a lower \nsimilarity matrix correlation with other languages (average of \n0.727) and Italian scores an even lower average correlation, 0.713. This \nsuggests that these two latter languages interpret emojis in a slightly \ndifferent way than the other languages, especially Italian.\nLooking at the single emoji-pairs similarities, the strongest correlation is \nbetween USA and UK (0.760), probably supported by similar \nvocabularies, and the weakest is between USA and ITA (0.698). On the \nother hand, Italian has high correlation with Spanish (0.739), while \nSpanish correlates better with Italian and American English than British \nEnglish.\"\nBarbieri, F., Kruszewski, G., Ronzano, F., & Saggion, H.
