In this section we compare the syntax and semantics of the C-SPARQL language with \nour own proposal. We postpone the discussion of the execution environment to the next section. \nRDF Stream\nWe have adopted the C-SPARQL approach for an RDF stream, i.e. an annotated sequence of \nRDF triples. We have also used their mechanism for declaring a stream in the FROM clause.\nWe extend the FROM clause to support aliases for stream graphs. This enables different \nwindows to be specified over same graph, i.e. self-joins between the current and past of a \nstream graph.\nWindows\nWe follow the C-SPARQL approach of declaring a window over a stream in the FROM clause. \nHowever, we have \n●\nextended the expressiveness of the window operator by allowing windows to declare \nboth the start and the end points relative to the evaluation time;\n●\nmade explicit the result type of a window operator, i.e. a window of RDF triples/tuples;\n●\nremoved the semantically ambiguous triple-based window.\nWe have also added support for window-to-stream operators.\nStored Data\nWe have provided an evaluation semantics for relating stored and streaming data by converting \nstored data into a stream of triple windows using the SCAN operator.\nAggregates\nC-SPARQL proposes a form of aggregates that extends, rather than summarising, the data.
