Henceforth, for brevity, given an integer n > 0 we\nwill denote by [n] the set {1,...,n}. The isa clause is optional.\nAn attribute deﬁnition has the form\nattribute A of X\nqualiﬁcation,\nwhere (i) A ∈Att is the attribute to be deﬁned, (ii) X ∈(Ent∪Rel) is either the entity\nor the relationship to which the attribute is associated, and (iii) qualiﬁcation con-\nsists of none, one, or both of the keywords mandatory and functional, specifying\nrespectively that each instance of X needs to have at least one value for attribute\nA, and that each instance of X has a unique value for A. If both mandatory and\nfunctional are missing, the attribute is assumed by default to be optional and multi-\nvalued, respectively.\nWe assume, without loss of generality, that each attribute is associated to a unique\nentity or relationship, i.e., different entities and relationships have disjoint sets of\nattributes. Also, for simplicity, we assume that attributes have atomic values.\nExample 1.2. Consider the ER+schema C deﬁned as follows:\nentity Member\nparticipates(⩾1): Works in : 1\nparticipates(⩽1): Works in : 1\nentity Phd student\nisa: Member\nentity Professor\nisa: Member\nparticipates(⩽1): Leads : 1\nentity Group\nparticipates(⩾1): Works in : 2, Leads : 2\nparticipates(⩽1): Leads : 2\nrelationship Works in among Member, Group\nrelationship Leads among Professor, Group\nisa: Works in[1,2]\nattribute memb name of Member\nmandatory, functional\nattribute stud gpa of Phd student\nattribute gr name of Group\nattribute since of Works in.\nIt is easy to verify that C is actually the schema depicted in Figure 1.1.\n",
