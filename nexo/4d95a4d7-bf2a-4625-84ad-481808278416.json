As a result, the plaintiff won a successful bid for the estate with a higher price than the\nactual value of the estate given that the plaintiff did not have the information that the property was stigmatized. The\nplaintiff claims compensation for damage and delay from the defendant.\n[Issue Topic 2]: Whether the execution officer D was negligent or not.\nThe measures performed by the officer were those that are normally implemented for examination. From the\ncircumstances which the execution officer D perceived, he could not have realized that the estate was stigmatized. The\nofficer cannot be regarded as negligent in that negligence would imply a dereliction of duty of inspection, which, given\nthat there were sufficient checks, did not happen.\nConcerning the question whether the officer had the duty to check whether the estate was stigmatized, we can\nobserve various matters -- in actuality, the person who killed himself happened to be the owner of the estate and the\nlegal representative of the Revolving Credit Mortgage concerned, the house then became vacant and was offered for\nauction, but we can also observe the following: other persons but the owner himself could have committed suicide in\nthe estate, for instance friends and family; there was a long time frame during which the suicide could have happened;\nthe neighbors might not have answered the officer's questions in a forthcoming manner, even if they were aware of\nthe fact that the estate was stigmatized; there are several factors to affect the value of the estate beyond the fact that\nthe estate was stigmatized, and it is not realistic neither from a time perspective nor an economic perspective to\nexamine all such factors specifically; and the bidders in the auction were in a position to examine the estate personally\nas the location of the estate was known -- taking these relevant matters into consideration, it is a justified statement\nthat the officer didn’t have the duty to check in a proactive manner whether the estate was stigmatized.\nTherefore, the plaintiff’s claim is unreasonable since it is hard to say that the officer was negligent.\nGiven what has been said above, it is not necessary to judge the other points; the plaintiff’s claim is unreasonable so\nthe judgment returns to the main text.\nLv0, Lv1, Lv2, Lv3, Lower\nType B2 summary sample\n",
