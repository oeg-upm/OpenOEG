Extract the data model. The goal of this task is to ﬁnd out how the conceptual schema\nof the non-ontological resource and its content are represented in the data model. If the non-\nontological resource data model is not available in the documentation, the data model should be\nreconstructed manually or by using a data modeling tool.\n2. Non-Ontological Resource Transformation, whose goal is to generate a conceptual model from\nthe non-ontological resource. We propose the use of Patterns for Re-engineering Non-Ontological\nResources (PR-NOR) to guide the transformation process.\n• Task 4. Search for a suitable pattern for re-engineering non-ontological resource. The\ngoal of this task is to ﬁnd out if there is any applicable re-engineering pattern to transform\nthe non-ontological resource into a conceptual model. To search for a suitable pattern for re-\nengineering non-ontological resource the NeOn library of patterns2 can be used, according to\nthe non-ontological resource, the data model, and the semantics of the relations between the\nnon-ontological resource entities. First, the non-ontological resource type has to be identiﬁed.\nSecond, the internal data model of the non-ontological resource has to be identiﬁed as well.\nThird, the semantics of the relations between the non-ontological resource entities have to be\nidentiﬁed, these semantics can be a)subClassOf, b) an ad-hoc relation like partOf or c) a mix of\n2http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org\n2006–2008 c⃝Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions.\n",
