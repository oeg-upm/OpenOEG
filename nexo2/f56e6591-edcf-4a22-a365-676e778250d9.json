The goal of this task\nis to apply the re-engineering pattern obtained in task 4 to transform the classiﬁcation scheme into\na conceptual model. If a suitable pattern for re-engineering classiﬁcation scheme is found then the\nconceptual model is created from the classiﬁcation scheme following the procedure established in the\npattern for re-engineering.\n• Task 5.b. Perform and ad-hoc transformation. The goal of this task is to set up an ad-hoc pro-\ncedure to transform the classiﬁcation scheme into a conceptual model, when a suitable pattern for\nre-engineering was not found. This ad-hoc procedure may be generalized to create a new pattern for\nre-engineering classiﬁcation scheme.\n2006–2008 c⃝Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions.\n",
