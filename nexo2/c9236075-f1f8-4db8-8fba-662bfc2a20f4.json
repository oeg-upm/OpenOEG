It could be wave2:significatWaveHeightValue, but this is not necessarily \nthe case.\n \n \nthe annotation should then be more complete, like:\ncolumn Hs --> x? a wave:WaveHeightMeasurement; x? wave:hasValue Hs;  \nwhich is essentially a mapping definition (s2o like)\n \n \nO-O mappings\nOut of the scope for the moment, most likely be based on Sharffe et al. work (See here).\nPart of Jean-Paul’s research at UPM.\n \n \nWorkplan\nIdentify timescales and deliverables.
