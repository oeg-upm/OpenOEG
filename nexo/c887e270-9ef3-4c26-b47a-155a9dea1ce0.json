(1997) \n \nFrom the characteristics in Figures 3 and 4 combined with examples given \nin the above mentioned two papers we can deduce that meta ontology in Fig-\nure 3 is equivalent to knowledge representation ontology in Figure 4. \nFigure 5: Ontologies according to Guarino (1998) \n \nGuarino (1998:9) has the small diagram shown in Figure 5, which is often \ncited in the ontology literature. It should be noted, however, that the relations \nin Guarino’s illustration do not represent generalizations among the types of \nontologies, but rather generalizations between the concepts in these ontolo-\ngies when they are linked together, cf. Guarino (1998:10): “Domain ontolo-\ngies … describe the vocabulary related to a generic domain … by specializ-\ning the terms introduced in a top-level ontology”. According to the explana-\ntions of the concepts (types of ontologies) given by Guarino, the ontology \nshould rather be structured as in Figure 6. Interestingly, this is very similar to \npart of the ontology by Mizoguchi et al. (1995) in Figure 3. A problem with \nthe ontology in Figure 6 is the polyhierarchy since, according to the above \n \n6\n \n",
