These APIs will be \ngenerated with our approach and one/two from the SoA.\n• Give a set of task to Application Developers and see how \nthey use these APIs to execute them. \n§ Expected results:\no Application developers spends less time understanding our \nontology-based API approach and as a result less time doing \nthose given tasks compared to other tools.\no Data retrieved from the ontology-based API is enough to \nsolve the intended use cases of the ontology.\n",
