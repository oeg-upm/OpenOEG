In this case, every classiﬁcation scheme item has the\nparent code. Figure 4.4 shows this data model.\nFigure 4.4: Adjacency list data model.\nSnowﬂake Data Model\nA snowﬂake data model [MZ06] is a normalized structure for hierarchy representations. In this case, the\nclassiﬁcation scheme items are grouped by levels or entities.\nThere are as many groups as levels the\nclassiﬁcation scheme has. In this model every classiﬁcation scheme item has the parent code (i.e. parent key\nvalue), just like the adjacency list data model. However, the difference is that in the snowﬂake data model the\nclassiﬁcation scheme items are grouped by levels or entities, and therefore hierarchy levels must be known\nin advance. Figure 4.5 illustrates this model. Optionally, a relation between the groups, or entities, can be\nexist.\nFigure 4.5: Adjacency list data model.\n2006–2008 c⃝Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions.\n",
