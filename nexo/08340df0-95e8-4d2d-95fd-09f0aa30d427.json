The \nauthors advocate an integrated lightweight approach for formally describing semantic \nRESTful services. This approach is based on use of the hREST and MicroWSMO \nmicroformats, which enable the creation of machine-readable service descriptions and \nthe addition of semantic annotations. Furthermore, the authors present SWEET, a tool \nwhich effectively supports users in creating semantic descriptions of RESTful \nservices based on the aforementioned technologies. Unlike this work, our approach is \nbased on an automatic semantic description of services. Once the semantics of the \nRESTful service is obtained, this could be represented in any of the existing semantic \ndescription approaches, such as hREST, MicroWSMO, etc.  \nFinally, another approach for service description that focuses on automation, and \nhence may be closer to our work, is presented in [17]. This approach classifies service \ndatatypes using HTML treated Web form files as the Web service's parameters. In this \napproach Naïve Bayes is used to classify assigned semantic types to the input and \noutput parameters.  \n3 An approach for the automatic semantic annotation of RESTful \nservices \nIn this section, we present our approach, visualized in Figure 1, for automating the \nsyntactic and semantic annotation of RESTful services. Our system consists of three \nmain components, including invocation and registration, repository, and semantic \nannotation components, which are enriched by diverse external resources. Next, we \nbriefly describe the different components, illustrating the descriptions with some \nsample services on the geospatial domain.  \n \n \nFigure 1.
