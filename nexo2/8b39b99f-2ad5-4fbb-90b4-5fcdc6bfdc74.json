To\nmodel the earthquake depth and magnitude observations we used the Semantic\nSensor Network ontology [7]. Figure 3 shows a concept map for depth obser-\nvations. Namespaces are deﬁned in the ﬁle resulting of the transformation to\nRDF/Turtle, linked in next subsection.\nFig. 3. Concept map for depth observations.\nMagnitude observations (ssn:Observation) are result of a sensor output\n(ssn:SensorOutput) that produces a ﬂoat value (ssn:ObservationValue). The\nproperty observed is a magnitude scale (sweet:EarthquakeScale) used to mea-\nsure the severity of earthquakes (ssn:FeatureOfInterest). IGN provides an es-\ntimation of the instant (time:Instant) at which the earthquake happened\n(ssn:observationSamplingTime). The sensors used to measure seismic activity\nare not represented in the dataset. For this reason, we attached a geometry point\n(geosparql:Geometry) to each observation (which is also a geosparql:feature) that\nrepresents where the earthquake happened. Geometries are serialized as Well-\nKnown Text (geosparql:wktLiteral). The model for magnitude observations is\nvery similar, but it includes in the observation value the unit of measurement\n(dul:UnitOfMeasurement).\n",
