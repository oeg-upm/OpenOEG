Values: integer\n• M1: Number of resources with dbo:elevation in EN DBpedia that have dbo:height in ES \nDBpedia\n• M2: Number of resources with dbo:elevation in EN that have dbo:height in ES and the \nobject values are identical (equivalent).\n• M3 (false positives in M2): Number of resources in EN that are also in ES, having same \nobject, but different property. E.g. people can have same dbo:birthPlace and \ndbo:deathPlace but this doesn't mean that dbo:birthPlace and dbo:deathPlace are the \nsame property or are wrongly mapped. Another example: people who is actor and \nproducer (dbo:directedBy and dbo:actor).\n• M4 (EN): Number of resources in EN with dbo:elevation and dbo:height (wrong \nmapping) vs. dbo:birthPlace and dbo:deathPlace (different relations)\n• M4 (ES): analogous to M4(EN) but for ES\n",
