These techniques are based on predicting the structure of the incoming queries as well as catching augmented triple patterns. The experiments show that these techniques can provide an effective mechanism to avoid the execution of the incoming SPARQL queries and a fast response exploiting the cached information. This \"TFM\" would implement these techniques in order to achieve a prefetching layer for current SPARQL endpoint engines like Virtuoso or Fuseki.\n- Funding schema: not funded\nTitle MR2: \"Analysis on new features for a smart Query Prefetching System for SPARQL endpoints\".\n- Description MR2: Recent works point out machine learning based techniques to create more effective SPARQL endpoints. These techniques are based on predicting the structure of the incoming queries as well as catching augmented triple patterns. The experiments show that these techniques can provide an effective mechanism to avoid the execution of the incoming SPARQL queries and a fast response exploiting the cached information. This \"TFM\" would study new features (like time between queries) that could enhance the current results.\n- Funding schema: not funded\nTitle MR3: \"Detection of types in DBpedia based on machine learning techniques\"\n- Description MR3: Recent works have pointed out the benefits of machine learning approaches to predict the type of DBpedia resources. This \"TFM\" will focus on analyzing new approaches to improve the current state of the art. The supervisor will provide some suggestions but the student will have the chance to propose new approaches.\n- Funding schema: not funded\nTitle MR4: \"Generation of semantic information from natural language sources\"\n- Description MR4: With the recent advances (e.g. SyntaxNet) in the analysis of texts in natural language, the conversion of texts into RDF triples is becoming a real possibility. This \"TFM\" will analyze the state of the art and its application to a real use case: DBpedia. From the textual information about a given resource, many new triples will be generated. This new information must be analyzed to validate its correctness before being added to the DBpedia. This work can apply to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 to get prestige and additional funding. GSoC 2019 funded this project.\n- Funding schema: perhaps GSoC (\nGoogle Summer of Code\n)\nTitle MR5: \"Live Spanish DBpedia\"\n- Description MR5: the Spanish DBpedia is the second biggest DBpedia after the English one. Aimed at keeping its data updated, the DBpedia foundation has created\nDBpedia Data Bus\n, an alternative to\nDBpedia Live\n. This TFM will be focused on this software engineering problem and the solutions provided, initially for the Spanish DBpedia but, potentially, for any DBpedia.\n- Funding schema: perhaps DBpedia Foundation\nTitle MR6: \"Data Analytics applied to DBpedia error detection\"\n- Description MR6: gamification techniques are a valuable method to detect errors in DBpedia (or any other knowledge graph). This TFM will use Data Analytics techniques over the logs of\nan existing mobile application\nto extract potential errors. These potential errors will feed a web application in which human users will verify these issues.

Most approaches focus on visualizing the concepts (T-box) or the instances (A-box), or both\nAntoniazzi 2018\n. However, in day-to-day activities, in which we create knowledge graphs (typically from external sources), we miss a visualization paradigm that show us simplified visualizations of the RDF graph. This TFM will be focused on providing this new visualization paradigm by using RDF data from\nSlideWiki\n, an European research project. Proficient knowledge of JavaScript language and web development is a must.\n- Funding schema: perhaps GSoC (\nGoogle Summer of Code\n)\nTitle MR8: \"A POS-pattern based tool to assist users on creating terminologies\"\n- Description MR8: There is a lack of user interaction in the current syntactic systems used for terminology extraction. This project is aimed at coping these deficiencies with a friendly user interface that allows users to provide fine-grain information to assist terminologist with powerful but ease-of-use online tools.\n- Funding schema: perhaps AInnoSpace (Accenture).\nTitle MR9: \"Applying Deep Learning techniques to terminology extraction in specific domains\"\n- Description MR9: The recent application of Deep Learning techniques to keyphrase extraction (\nSahrawat 2019\n) by using deep contextual language models such as ELMo and BERT have enhanced the performance in the domain of Automatic Term Extraction. This TFM is aimed at applying these techniques to specific domains such as technology or law.\n- Funding schema: perhaps AInnoSpace (Accenture).\nTitle MR10: \"A user experience evaluation of multi-term searching techniques in specific domain corpora\"\n- Description MR10: Using the latest UX (user experience) methods we will evaluate search technologies based in phrasal nouns. A comparison to classical keyword search will be carried out paying attention to specific domains such as technology or law.\n- Funding schema: perhaps AInnoSpace (Accenture).\nTitle MR11: \"Allergies and Contamination: an study based on Open Data and Machine Learning\"\n- Description MR11: The Open Data initiative is increasing the number of data sources. In this TFM we will focus on pollutant levels (PL) provided by several local administrations. When some PL exceed the recommended thresholds, the users of the proposed system will get a notification of their mobiles (based on their geolocation). Additionally, if the user indicates to the app some type of symptom (itching, coughing, etc.) we could predict allergic episodes and what is the pollutant that prejudices him/her. The student should have basic skills on mobile app development.\n- Funding schema: perhaps AInnoSpace (Accenture).\nTitle MR12: \"esDBpedia data analytics and error reporter tool\"\n- Description MR12: esDBpedia (the Spanish chapter of DBpedia) needs an error reporter tool. Anybody who detects a wrong data in esDBpedia could use the proposed web tool (integrated inside the web site of esDBpedia) to report the error. This error will be labeled as \"possible error\" and the tool will have to analyze the error reported in order to verify it. This problem can be approached in several ways, but we propose initially a \"collaborative\" approach, by using other users to validate statistically the error. The student should have solid skills on web development.\n- Funding schema: perhaps GSoC (\nGoogle Summer of Code\n)\nEsteban Gonz√°lez",
