It could instead be done by assembling reusable components.\nSystem developers would then only need to worry about creating the specialized knowledge and\nreasoners new to the specific task of their systems. This new system would interoperate with\nexisting systems, using them to perform some of its reasoning. In this way,\ndeclarative knowledge, problem-solving techniques, and reasoning services could all\nbe shared between systems. This approach would facilitate building bigger and better systems\ncheaply.
