Pattern for re-engineering a classiﬁcation scheme which follows the ﬂattened data\nmodel\nThe pattern for re-engineering non-ontological resource shown in Table 4.4 suggests a guide to transform a\nclassiﬁcation scheme into an ontology. The classiﬁcation scheme is modeled/represented with a ﬂattened\ndata model. This pattern aims at creating a taxonomy from the classiﬁcation scheme, being the semantics\nof the relations between classiﬁcation scheme items the subClassOf relationship.\nTable 4.4: Pattern for Re-engineering a Classiﬁcation Scheme which follows the\nﬂattened data model.\nSlot\nValue\nGeneral Information\nName\nClassiﬁcation scheme to Taxonomy (ﬂattened model)\nIdentiﬁer\nPR-NOR-CLTX-04\nType of Component\nPattern for Re-engineering Non-Ontological Resource (PR-NOR)\nUse Case\nGeneral\nRe-engineering a classiﬁcation scheme which follows the ﬂattened model to design a taxon-\nomy.\nExample\nSuppose that someone wants to build an ontology based on a classiﬁcation published as one\ntable with a column for each classiﬁcation level.\nPattern for Re-engineering Non-Ontological Resource\nINPUT: Resource to be Re-engineered\nGeneral\nA non-ontological resource holds a classiﬁcation scheme which follows the ﬂattened data\nmodel.\nA classiﬁcation scheme is a rooted tree of concepts, in which each concept groups entities\nby some particular degree of similarity. The semantics of the hierarchical relation between\nparents and children concepts may vary depending of the context.\nThe ﬂattened data model [MZ06] is a denormalized structure for hierarchy representations.\nIn this case, each hierarchy level is represented on a different column. There are as many\ncolumns as levels the classiﬁcation scheme has. Therefore each row has the complete path\nfrom the root to a leaf node.\nExample\nThe Classiﬁcation of Italian Education Titles published by the National Institute of Statistics\n(ISTAT) is represented following a ﬂattened model. The ﬁrst level of the classiﬁcation (level\ncode) is related to the education title level which comprises values as elementary, media,\nuniversity, master, etc. The second level of the classiﬁcation is the type of school or institute\nwhich offers the education title. The last level is the education title itself; it has a speciﬁc\nspecialization code and also a code which is the concatenation of the previous code levels.\nGraphical Representation\nGeneral\n",
