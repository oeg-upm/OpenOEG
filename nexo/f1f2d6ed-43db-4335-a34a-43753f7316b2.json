It is a rigorously tested and proven method of measuring software quality from the end user’s point of view. SUMI studies the following 5 dimensions (\nref\n):\nEfficiency: measures the degree to which users feel that the software assists them in their work and is related to the concept of transparency.\nAffect: measures the user’s general emotional reaction to the software (aka Likeability).\nHelpfulness: measures the degree to which the software is self-explanatory, as well as more specific things like the adequacy of help facilities and documentation.\nControl: measures the extent to which the user feels in control of the software, as opposed to being controlled by the software, when carrying out the task.\nLearnability: measures the speed and facility with which the user feels that they have been able to master the system, or to learn how to use new features when necessary.\nHow to use it\n\nFor this task we request users to fulfill an online SUMI survey (e.g.\nat\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/\n) that is the de facto industry standard evaluation\nquestionnaire consisting of 50 statements (10 for each dimension) to which the user\nhas to reply that he either Agree, Don’t know, or Disagree. Users select Agree or\nDisagree if the statement is generally true or wrong respectively. The third option\n(Don’t know) is selected if the user is undecided, cant make up his mind, or if the\nstatement has no relevance to the software or to the situation. You can find an example\nhere\n.\nPerlman questionnaires\n\nAnother source of questionnaires can be found at\nPerlman site",
