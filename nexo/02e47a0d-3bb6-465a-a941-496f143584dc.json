A \nlot of organisations have diﬀerent sources of data in diﬀerent \nformats, and sometimes they even diﬀer in their modelling schemes.  This \nprocess is often carried out by engineers. It can be cumbersome to integrate the \ndata from diﬀerent sources manually. It is common to have domain experts -who \nunderstand the data about a speciﬁc topic- are needed to convey the meaning to \nthe engineer.  The engineers would then integrate the data by transforming it from \none model or schema to another. This can be time-consuming, \nerror-prone and not easy to maintain.  This also costs \norganisations money, especially the ones with many datasets, which is \noften the case for medium and large organisations.  On the other hand, \nArtiﬁcial Intelligence can help automate part of this and \nsave money and oﬀer more value than classical data integration. This can saves \norganisations time and money. However, there is a lack in the literature about the \nmarket studies about data integration and the utilisation of Artiﬁcial Intelligence. In \nthis work, we perform market analysis studying more than ﬁfty data integration \nproducts and services and their relation with Artiﬁcial Intelligence. We also show \nhow organisations with a lot of data can make money using data \nintegration tools powered by Artiﬁcial Intelligence.  \n",
