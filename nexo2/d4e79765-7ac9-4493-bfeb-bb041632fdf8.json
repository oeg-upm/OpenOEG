We highly encourage participants to \nmake use of model checkpoints in creative ways.\n• For both tracks, all participants' submissions will be evaluated using \ntwo criteria:\n• the accuracy that the system reached on the binary classification\n• the Spearman correlation of the systems' output probabilities with the \nproportion of the annotators marking the item as overgenerating\n",
