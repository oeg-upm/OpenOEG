Example of such activities are: ontology specification, ontology conceptualization, \nontology reuse, and ontology implementation. \nThe other activities (the “if-applicable” ones, like ontology customization, ontology localization, and \nontology aligning) are optional in the ontology development process, and they should be carried \nout depending on the concrete case. For example, if the ontology is developed in English, and as a \nrequirement the ontology should be available in other natural languages (such as, French and \nSpanish), the ontology localization activity should be carried out.  \n \n \n",
