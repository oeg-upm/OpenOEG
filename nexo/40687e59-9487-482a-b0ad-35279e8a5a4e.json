Select all the classiﬁcation scheme items from the ﬁrst level, using the level column\nand taking care to avoid duplicity.\n2. For each one of the above selected classiﬁcation scheme items cei:\n2.1. Create the corresponding ontology class, Ci class.\n2.2. Identify the classiﬁcation scheme items, cej, on the next level, which are chil-\ndren of cei, by using the path and level columns.\n2.3. For each one of the above identiﬁed classiﬁcation scheme items cej:\n2.3.1. Create the corresponding ontology class, Cj class.\n2.3.2. Set up the subClassOf relation between Cj and Ci.\n2.3.3. Repeat from step 2.2 for cej as a new cei.\n3. If there are more than one classiﬁcation scheme items from the ﬁrst level cei\n3.1. Create an ad-hoc class as the root class of the ontology.\n3.2. Set up the subClassOf relation between Ci class and the root class.\nExample\n1. Create the HIGHER SECONDARY EDUCATION class.\n1.1. Create the Istituto professionale agrario class and set up the\nsubClassOf relation between the Istituto professionale agrario\nclass and the HIGHER SECONDARY EDUCATION class.\n1.1.1. Create the Esperto frutticoltore class and set up the subClas-\nsOf relation between the Esperto frutticoltore class and the\nIstituto professionale agrario class.\n1.1.2. Create the Esperto olivicoltore class and set up the subClas-\nsOf relation between the Esperto olivicoltore class and the\nIstituto professionale agrario class.\n2. Create\nthe\nHIGHER SECONDARY EDUCATION - ALLOWS ACCESS TO\nUNIVERSITIES class.\n3. Create the Education Title class.\n4. Set up the subClassOf relation between the HIGHER SECONDARY EDUCATION\nclass and the Education Title class.\n5. Set up the subClassOf relation between the HIGHER SECONDARY EDUCATION\n- ALLOWS ACCESS TO UNIVERSITIES class and the Education Title\nclass.\nRelationships\nRelations to other\nmodelling components\nUse the Architectural Pattern: TX-AP-01 [SFBG+07]\n4.3.2\nPatterns for Re-engineering Classiﬁcation Schemes into Lightweight Ontologies\nIn this section we present the re-engineering patterns (PR-NOR) for re-engineering classiﬁcation schemes\ninto lightweight ontologies. Since a lightweight ontology [SFBG+07] has additional ad-hoc relations between\nclasses, and, path enumeration and adjacency list data models only deal with one relationship, the patterns\nproposed in this section are only based on snowﬂake and ﬂattened data models, because they deal with\nmore than one relation. These patterns follow the transformation approach, mentioned in section 2.2.2,\nfor transforming resource schema into an ontology schema, and resource content into ontology instances,\nbecause it is the suitable for dealing with the resource data models and the target lightweight ontologies.\n",
