By deﬁning g to be\nthe composition fe3 ◦fe2 ◦fe1, we get that the permutation associated toC is πG(C) =\n[g(1),g(2),g(3)] = [1,2,3] = id3. Hence, the ﬁrst condition of the Deﬁnition 1.4 is\nsatisﬁed. Due to the edge r1[1]↷r3[3], the second condition is also satisﬁed. Thus,\nΣ is non-conﬂicting.\nThe following example shows that during the construction of the chase of a\ndatabase with respect to a set of non-conﬂicting CDs, a KD may be violated which\nimplies that the KD chase rule must be applied.\nExample 1.7. Consider the set Σ of non-conﬂicting CDs given in Example 1.4. Let\nD = {professor(p),leads(p,g)}. During the construction of chase(D,Σ), we add\nthe atoms member(p), works in(p,g) and works in(p,z1), where z1 ∈ΓN. The KD\nkey(works in) = {1} of Σ implies that p cannot participates more than once in\nWorks in as the ﬁrst component. Thus, we deduce that z1 = g. We must therefore\nreplace each occurrence of z1 with g in the part of the chase(D,Σ) constructed so\nfar.\n",
