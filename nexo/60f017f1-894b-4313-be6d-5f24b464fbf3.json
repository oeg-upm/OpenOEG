It also needs to be clarified whether top-level ontology in Guarino \n(1998) is synonymous to general ontology in the other diagrams presented \nhere, since the examples of what they contain (illustrated in white boxes in \nFigures 3, 4, 6 and 8) seem to be identical.  \nThese were a few examples of the difficulties we find in the typology of \nGómez-Pérez et al. (2003) and other authors. In section 3 we will introduce \nanother way of structuring the domain of ontologies. \n \n3 Proposal for an ontology for ontologies adhering to the princi-\nples of terminology \n \nFigure 9 contains a first draft of a part of the ontology of ontologies that we \nare going to propose to the Ontology Task Force of ISO TC 37. The descrip-\ntion of the concepts has to a great extent been based on Guarino (1998). \nIn this ontology we have introduced characteristics and subdivision criteria \nthat clearly distinguish the types of ontologies, e.g. LEVEL, DOMAIN and \nPURPOSE. \nFigure 9: Part of an ontology for ontologies \n \n \n9\n",
