As\nan example, Figure 4.9 shows a classiﬁcation scheme modeled following a path enumeration model. In this\ncase, the classiﬁcation scheme is implemented in a database and in an XML ﬁle.\nFigure 4.9: Classiﬁcation Scheme Categorization\n4.3\nPatterns for Re-engineering Classiﬁcation Schemes into Ontologies\nIn this section we present the re-engineering patterns (PR-NOR) for re-engineering classiﬁcation schemes\ninto ontologies. These patterns come from the experience of ontology engineers in developing ontologies\nusing classiﬁcation schemes in several projects (SEEMP3, NeOn4, and Knowledge Web5). The patterns are:\n• PR-NOR-CLTX-01. Pattern for re-engineering a classiﬁcation scheme which follows the path enumer-\nation data model, into a taxonomy. In that case, the semantics of the relations between classiﬁcation\n3http://www.seemp.org\n4http://www.neon-project.org\n5http://knowledgeweb.semanticweb.org\n2006–2008 c⃝Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions.\n",
