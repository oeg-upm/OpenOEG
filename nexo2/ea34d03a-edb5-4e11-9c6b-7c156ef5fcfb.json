If they can be implemented, we recommend reusing both the reflexivity \nand the antisymmetry of part_of, and the weak supplementation principle. \nThis heuristic has the purpose of ensuring the right meaning of part_of and proper_part_of. \nHeuristic 15 (transitivity). Suppose that the ontology should model X that has parts X1, X2, …, Xn, and some of these \nparts, e.g., Xi has parts Xi1, Xi2, …, Xim, that is, X has several levels of parts. Besides, we want to know all the levels \nwhen we ask, which are the parts of X? In such a case, the transitivity axiom should be reused. \nHeuristic 16 (reuse of definitions). The new terms appearing in the CQs after the reformulation proposed in Use \nCase 2.1 should be included in the general ontology. \nHeuristic 17. Heuristic 16 is also valid for time. \nHeuristic 18 (absolute time). If the CQ can be expressed as When does X happen?, then the ontology should model \nabsolute time (by means of time units). \nHeuristic 19 (relations between time entities). If the CQ can be expressed such as Does X happen before Y?, Does \nX happen after Y?, Does X happen at the same time as Y? among others, where X and Y are time entities or events, \nthen the ontology should model relations between time entities. \nHeuristic 20 (relative time). If the CQ can be expressed according to the pattern of Heuristic 19, where, X and Y are \nevents, then the ontology should model relative time. \n",
