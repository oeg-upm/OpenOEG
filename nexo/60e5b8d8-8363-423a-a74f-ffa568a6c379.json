The reuse of such non-\nontological resources necessarily involves their re-engineering into ontological resources. Non-ontological\nresources are highly heterogeneous in their data models and contents: they encode different types of knowl-\nedge, and can be modeled and implemented in different ways. In order to support and promote such reuse\nand re-engineering based approach, new methods, techniques and tools are needed.\nThe main goal of this deliverable is to present a set of methods and tools for re-engineering non-ontological\nresources into ontologies. Thus\n• As for classiﬁcation schemes and thesauri, we present methods based on a re-engineering model that\nwe have adapted from the general model for software re-engineering. The methods rely on the use of\nPatterns for Re-engineering Non-ontological Resources (PR-NOR). These methods are extensions of\nthe methods presented on D.5.4.1 [SFdCB+08].\n• With respect to folksonomies, we present a method with its respective tool that creates an ontological\nstructure for a folksonomy of a speciﬁc domain by employing automatically selected knowledge from\nonline available ontologies.\n• With respect to corpora, we present a method and a tool that identify patterns for the extraction of\nentities from unstructured text, and re-engineers these entities into concepts and instances (ontology\ncreation and population).\n",
