Non-Conﬂicting CDs\nIn this subsection we show that the non-conﬂicting condition is a sufﬁcient and nec-\nessary condition for separability. We ﬁrst establish that every set of non-conﬂicting\nCDs is separable. To this aim we need an auxiliary technical lemma.\nLemma 1.1. Consider a database D for a schema R, and a set Σ = ΣT ∪ΣK of non-\nconﬂicting CDs over R, where ΣT are TGDs and ΣK are KDs. If chase(D,Σ) does\nnot fail, then there exists a homomorphism h that maps chase(D,Σ) to chase(D,ΣT).\nProof. We proceed by induction on the number of applications of the (TGD or KD)\nchase rules in the construction of chase(D,Σ). We need to show that, for each k ⩾\n0, there exists a homomorphism hk that maps chase[k](D,Σ) to a set of atoms of\nchase(D,ΣT).\nBASE STEP. Clearly, for k = 0, chase[0](D,Σ) = D ⊆chase(D,ΣT). Therefore, the\nclaim holds trivially with h0 be the identity homomorphism on dom(D).\nINDUCTIVE STEP. By induction hypothesis there exists a homomorphism hk−1 such\nthat hk−1(chase[k−1](D,Σ)) ⊆chase(D,ΣT). We proceed by considering the two\ncases where the applied rule is either the TGD or the KD chase rule.\nSuppose that we apply the TGD chase rule because the TGD σ = r(X,Y) →\n∃Zs(X,Z) of ΣT is violated. This implies that there exists a homomorphism\nµ that maps r(X,Y) to a set of atoms of chase[k−1](D,Σ), and the atom a =\nµ′(s(X,Z)) is obtained, where µ′ is an extension of µ as in the TGD chase\nrule. Clearly, chase[k](D,Σ) = chase[k−1](D,Σ) ∪{a}. Observe that the homo-\nmorphism λ = hk−1 ◦µ maps r(X,Y) to a set of atoms of chase(D,ΣT). Since\nchase(D,ΣT) |= ΣT it follows that there exists λ ′ ⊇λ such that λ ′(s(X,Z)) ∈\nchase(D,ΣT). Denoting Z = Z1,...,Zm, for m ⩾0, we deﬁne the substitution\nhk = hk−1 ∪{µ′(Zi) →λ ′(Zi)}i∈[m]. Since none of the µ′(Zi) occurs in hk−1, it\nfollows that hk is a well-deﬁned substitution. Clearly, hk(a) = hk(µ′(s(X,Z))) =\ns(hk−1(µ(X)),hk(µ′(Z))) = s(λ(X),λ ′(Z)) = λ ′(s(X,Z)) ∈chase(D,ΣT). Thus,\nhk(chase[k](D,Σ)) ⊆chase(D,ΣT), as needed.\nNow, suppose that we apply the KD chase rule because the KD κ ∈ΣK is vio-\nlated. We proceed by case analysis on the type of κ.\nAssume ﬁrst that κ is of the form key(a) = {1}, where a ∈fae(R). This implies\nthat in chase[k−1](D,Σ) there exist two atoms a = a(c1,c2) and b = a(c1,c′\n2). If\n{c1,c2,c′\n2} ⊂Γ , then chase(D,Σ) fails and the claim holds trivially. The case where\n{c1,c2,c′\n2} ⊂ΓN, and also the case where c1 ∈Γ and {c2,c′\n2} ⊂ΓN are excluded\nsince, by deﬁnition of CDs, a and b must be the same atom which is a contradiction.\nNow, consider the case where {c1,c2} ⊂Γ and c′\n2 ∈ΓN (the case where {c1,c′\n2} ⊂Γ\nand c2 ∈ΓN is symmetric). Observe that, by deﬁnition of CDs, c′\n2 does not occur\nelsewhere in chase[k−1](D,Σ). This implies that by applying κ we just eliminate\natom b, and thus chase[k](D,Σ) ⊂chase[k−1](D,Σ). Consequently, hk = hk−1.\nAssume now that κ is of the form key(a) = [n], where a ∈far(R). This\nimplies that in chase[k−1](D,Σ) there exist two atoms a = a(c1,...,cn,cn+1)\nand b = a(c1,...,cn,c′\nn+1). If {c1,...,cn+1,c′\nn+1} ⊂Γ , then chase(D,Σ) fails\n",
