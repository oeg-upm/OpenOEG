Levels of experience on web technologies ranging from\nlow to high. A practical use case was created and presented to each participant.\nThis use case covered most of the functionality of the UpGrid application, such\nas annotation of images and audio, semantic search in the available semantic\nrepositories and management of friend's multimedia resources. This use case\ntypically required 30 minutes to each participant.\nAfter the use case, a detailed questionnaire was presented to each partic-\nipant (available at http://sites.google.com/site/upgridquestionnaire).\nThis questionnaire had 49 questions comprising three di\u001berent features: (a) user's\nskills in UPnP and web technologies, (b) usability of the Control Point and (c)\nuser's satisfaction concerning the User Interface of the Control Point. Most of\nthese questions were based on standard questionnaires [11].\nThe number of participants is a balance between precision and e\u001bort. As\nshown by formula (1), in order to achieve a 90% con\u001cdence level for a given\nmean with error less than 1%, it is required to take 15 measurements at least [7].\nThis assumes intervals based on a normal population distribution for mean, as\nwe consider it is the case.\n",
