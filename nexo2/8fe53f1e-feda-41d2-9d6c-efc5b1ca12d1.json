Villazón\n2\nOntological Engineering\nOntology Network Life Cycle Model\nAn ontology network life cycle model is defined as the framework, \nselected by each organization, on which to map the activities identified \nand defined in the NeOn Glossary of Activities in order to produce the \nontology network life cycle. \n As in Software Engineering, in the Ontology Engineering field, there is not a \nunique model valid for all ontology development projects, since each life \ncycle model is appropriate for a concrete development, depending on \nseveral features.\nThe ontology life cycle is the specific sequence of activities that the \nontology practitioners carry out for developing an ontology.\n\nNeOn Deliverable D5.3.1 (2007)\n\nI-SEMANTICS 2008\n\nPhD Thesis (2010)\n",
