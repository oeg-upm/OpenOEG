Spiral Life Cycle Model [15] \nThis life cycle model consists of the following four repetitive phases:  \n Planning: it is based on the requirements. \n Risk analysis: the decision of continuing with the development is taken according to the \nrequirements. \nRisk analysis is included as a step in the development process. This analysis serves as a \nway of evaluating each version of the system to determine whether development should \ncontinue. If the customer decides that any identified risks are too great, the project may be \nhalted. For example, if a substantial increase in cost or project completion time is identified \nduring one phase of risk analysis, the customer or the developer may decide that it does \nnot make sense to continue with the project, since the increased cost or lengthened \ntimeframe may make continuation of the project impractical or unfeasible. \nRisk management [52] is increasingly seen as one of the main jobs of project managers. It \ninvolves anticipating risks that might affect the project schedule or the quality of the \nsoftware being developed and taking action to avoid these risks. The results of the risk \nanalysis should be documented in the project plan along with an analysis of the \nconsequences of a risk ocurring. \nThere are three related categories of risk: \n¾ Project risks are risks that affect the project schedule or resources (e.g., the loss of an \nexperienced designer). \n¾ Product risks are risks that affect the quality or performance of the software being \ndeveloped (e.g., the failure of a purchased component to perform as expected). \n",
