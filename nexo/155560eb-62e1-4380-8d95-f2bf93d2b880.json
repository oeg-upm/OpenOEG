And what next?\nAbstract:\nThe talk will begin with some example to illustrate why reasoning is\nneeded for linked data and semantic web applications. I will then further\nexplain why approximate reasoning is need and how to perform faithful\napproximate reasoning, i.e, approximate reasoning with some level of\nquality control, by making use of tractable sub-languages in OWL 2.  I\nwill conclude the talk with discussions on some of our relevant recent\nwork and future steps, including those in the distributed setting.\nBio:\nJeff Z. Pan is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computing Science at\nUniversity of Aberdeen, where he is the Deputy Director of Research of the\ndepartment. He has over 100 refereed publications. He is an editor of the\nInternational Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS) and\nserves on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Web Semantics (JoWS). He\nserved as a program chair of the 1st Joint International Semantic\nTechnology Conference (JIST2011), of the 1st International Conference on\nWeb Reasoning and Rule System (RR2007), and of the Doctoral Consortiums in\nthe 9th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2010) in the 8th\nExtended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC2011). He is a key contributor to\nthe W3C OWL2 standard and is widely recognised for his work on scalable\nand efficient ontology reasoning and query answering (see e.g. the TrOWL\nTractable OWL2 reasoning infrastructure that he leads,\nhttp://trowl.eu/\n).",
