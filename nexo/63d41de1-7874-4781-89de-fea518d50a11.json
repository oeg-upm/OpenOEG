Activities Consensuated in the Third Round during July 2007 \nc. To exchange e-mails. Several e-mails were sent to the NeOn consortium to encourage \nother WPs to put forward their ideas. \nOnce the two ad-hoc meetings were held, WP5 partners decided that the existing \ndefinitions should be reviewed by other WPs within the NeOn consortium. Then, we \nidentified which activities are related to which WPs, taking into account the WP main \nobjectives, and we created and sent a table for obtaining feedback from WPs about \ndifferent activities. Table 2 presents the activities reviewed and commented by WP1 to \nWP4. Several activities were reviewed by more than one WP. This table will be useful for \nthe future methodological work within WP5, by means of informing about which WP is \nworking with each activity.  \nThe received comments were focused on differenciating or making equal some activity \ndefinitions, on including missing aspects in some activity definitions, and on deleting some \nactivities. All the received comments were taking into account during the second and third \nround of the process. \nTable 2.
