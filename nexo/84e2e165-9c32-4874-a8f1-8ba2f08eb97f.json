(2) Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of \nwords). (3) Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive \nor negative sentiment). (4) Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a \nsentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French). (5) Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video \nclassification where we wish to label each frame of the video). [9]\n",
