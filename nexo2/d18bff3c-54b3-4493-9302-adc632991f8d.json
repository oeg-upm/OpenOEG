Conical-Spiral Life Cycle Model [11] \nThe conical-spiral life cycle model would have the development of the ES on one plane, based on \na specific level of expert knowledge. Its development would involve the use of prototypes to define \nthe initial system and to refine the requirements and specifications, obtaining a review and \noperational prototype system [11]. The number of prototypes to be developed will depend on cost \nanalysis and problem complexity. Later, the ES would be integrated into a general purpose system \nto make a commercial system [11]. \nIn short, according to the authors [12], a life cycle model for an ES with a spiral structure and \nconical prototype, based on a modular design with small well-defined modules and on modules \nwhich are easily related to the problem and independent, would make it possible to obtain a highly \nmaintainable, adaptable, and flexible product, i.e., a minimum-cost system which is the aim of all \nmethodologies. \n2.6. Ontology Engineering: Development Process \n2.6.1. Ontology development process in METHONTOLOGY \nThe ontology development process [26, 14] was identified on the framework of the \nMETHONTOLOGY methodology for ontology construction. Such a proposal was based on the \nIEEE standard for software development [3]. The ontology development process was defined to \nrefer to which activities are performed when building ontologies. It is crucial to identify these \nactivities if agreement is to be reached on ontologies built by geographically distant cooperative \nteams. Such activities are organized into the three following categories, as Figure 9 shows: \nmanagement, development and support. \n2006–2007 © Copyright lies with the respective authors and their institutions. \n \n",
